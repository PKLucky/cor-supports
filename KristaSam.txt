speak;Sam;Hey, Krista. We haven't had the chance to actually catch up on things.
expression;Krista;Smile
speak;Krista;Yeah! What happened with you all this time?|You know, besides the whole bandit-killing thing.
speak;Sam;Not much beyond that.|But more importantly, what were you doing in Oregot?
expression;Krista;HalfCloseEyes,Smile
speak;Krista;Uh{tgm}...{tgm} things?
expression;Sam;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Sam;Things.
expression;Krista;NoSmile,NormalBlink
speak;Krista;Yup. Things.|Things that do not need any elaboration or detail whatsoever.
expression;Sam;NormalBlink
speak;Sam;Come on, Krista. Be honest with me.|No one goes to Oregot without rhyme or reason.|Especially not in its more bandit-infested regions.|You have a lot more important stuff to deal with than that, right?
speak;Krista;That's true. It's complicated though{tgm}...
speak;Sam;It can't be that hard to explain.
expression;Krista;CloseEyes
speak;Krista;I can't believe I gotta actually say this to you.|{c:e;Krista;NormalBlink}You remember how I got kidnapped by bandits years ago, right?
speak;Sam;How can I forget?
speak;Krista;Y'see, the thing is that I{tgm}...{tgm}|{c:e;Krista;CloseEyes}Dear Medea, how do I even begin to phrase this?|{c:e;Krista;NormalBlink}After all that, I kinda{tgm}...{tgm} liked it?
speak;Sam;What.
speak;Krista;I, uh. Liked getting kidnapped?
speak;Sam;...;no_talk
speak;Krista;Sam?
speak;Sam;You know what? Let's put this conversation on hold.|I need time to think.

speak;Sam;Alright, Krista. It's about time we discuss the elephant in the room.
speak;Krista;You mean--{c:e;Krista;CloseEyes}Oh, dear Medea, do we have to?|{c:e;Krista;HalfCloseEyes}I REALLY don't want to go any more in depth than I already have.
speak;Sam;Your explanation hardly makes any sense, though.|How can you LIKE getting kidnapped? You are deliberately putting yourself in danger!
expression;Krista;NormalBlink
speak;Krista;Yeah, but{tgm}...{c:e;Krista;CloseEyes}{tgm} *sigh* Here we go with the word choice again.|{c:e;Krista;NormalBlink}It{tgm}...{tgm} gets the blood pumping.
speak;Sam;Then just do more training.
speak;Krista;No, no, no, more like{tgm}...{tgm} it excites the senses?
speak;Sam;Just read a good book. I can give you recommendations.
expression;Krista;CloseEyes
speak;Krista;It's not like that either!
speak;Sam;So, what is it, then?

speak;Sam;Krista, we need to talk.
expression;Krista;CloseEyes
speak;Krista;Nope! Not having any more "talks" with you.{c:e;Krista;HalfCloseEyes} Been there, done that.
speak;Sam;We are having this talk even if I have to tie you to a chair.
expression;Krista;NormalBlink

speak;Krista;Wait, you're gonna WHAT?|{c:e;Krista;CloseEyes}Agh, no, getting distracted here.|{c:e;Krista;NormalBlink}A-Anyway, what's so important that you would tie me up to talk about it?
speak;Sam;Do you even know why I left Medeas in the first place?
speak;Krista;I dunno.{c:e;Krista;HalfCloseEyes} You wanted to see what Oregot was like?
speak;Sam;Krista, you're not that dumb or oblivious. Give me a real guess.
expression;Krista;CloseEyes,NoSmile
speak;Krista;Fine.|{c:e;Krista;NormalBlink}Well, it was after I got captured, and Chell's parents died in the rescue.|You were out for revenge?
expression;Sam;CloseEyes
speak;Sam;Not wrong, and not entirely right either.|{c:e;Sam;NormalBlink}I went there to kill every last bandit to ensure you wouldn't get captured again.|{c:e;Sam;CloseEyes}No one's gonna get hurt by those scum again.{c:e;Sam;HalfCloseEyes} Not on my watch.
expression;Krista;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Krista;I{tgm}...{tgm} I see.|{c:e;Krista;NormalBlink}Vengeance seemed like an obvious answer.|{c:e;Krista;CloseEyes}And, honestly, I thought you were mad at me too.
expression;Sam;NormalBlink
speak;Sam;Why would I be mad?
expression;Krista;NormalBlink
speak;Krista;It was my fault, Sam! It was because of me that they died!|{c:e;Krista;HalfCloseEyes}If I hadn't wandered off that day, they would still be alive{tgm}...
speak;Sam;Krista, there are millions of "what if's".|You're not doing yourself any favors by listing all the many different ones.|{c:e;Sam;CloseEyes}They may be true, they may not. Something else may have happened.|{c:e;Sam;NormalBlink}I went to try and make Oregot safer by|eliminating what makes it dangerous for everyone.|That much is guaranteed.
speak;Krista;Yeah, that's true{tgm}...{tgm}|{c:e;Krista;NormalBlink}I understand now. Thanks for telling me, Sam.|{c:e;Krista;CloseEyes}That's one less weight off my mind.
speak;Sam;That aside, why do you keep feigning ignorance all the time?|I know you're not like that at all.
expression;Krista;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Krista;I{tgm}...{tgm} I don't know.
expression;Sam;CloseEyes
speak;Sam;Hm{tgm}...{tgm} I think I know why.|{c:e;Sam;NormalBlink}That event back then scarred you in more ways than one,|resulting in how you portray yourself  now.
expression;Krista;CloseEyes
speak;Krista;...;no_talk
speak;Sam;You're smart and caring, Krista. You notice the details. Details that elude me at times.|And you always have everyone's best interests at heart.
expression;Krista;NormalBlink
speak;Krista;Sam{tgm}...
expression;Sam;CloseEyes
speak;Sam;And because of that, I know you will make a good queen of Medeas someday.|{c:e;Sam;NormalBlink}Don't forget that.
