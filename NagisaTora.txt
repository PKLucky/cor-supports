C Support
[Nagisa is busy training and Tora bumps into her. Tora is being antagonistic towards her and it ends up with the two of them sparring with each other.]

B Support
[Tora is complaining about whatever chore for the army he was assigned to do and Nagisa reprimands him for slacking off. There's a hint of a misunderstanding between the two. Tora interprets Nagisa's reprimands as her trying to flaunt some superiority over him. Nagisa just wants Tora to do his fucking job since they're allies.]

A Support
[This is where the two of them come to an understanding. Tora's anger towards Humans in general comes from uhhh *gestures vaguely at the War of Divides* Nagisa has an epiphany and sees a bit of herself in Tora.]
