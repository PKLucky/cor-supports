speak;Ryuuji;I've been doing some thinking lately, and I think we should drop formalities now.
speak;Tsubaki;What do you mean, Kenji?
speak;Ryuuji;I'm not under your service anymore,|so I don't see any reason to keep seeing you as my liege.|You're just some little girl in my eyes now.
speak;Tsubaki;P-Pardon?
speak;Ryuuji;So, instead of "Lady Tsubaki",|I'd say something like Tsuba or Baki would be more appropriate.

speak;Tsubaki;Hold for a moment! What's with those nicknames?|A-And more importantly, you may not be my retainer anymore,|but I'm still next in line to the throne.|There should still be some level of respect.
expression;Ryuuji;CloseEyes
speak;Ryuuji;You know what? You have a point.|{c:e;Ryuuji;NormalBlink}But, y'know, you gotta earn that respect.
speak;Tsubaki;Earn it?
speak;Ryuuji;Let's see you live up to being the emperor's daughter.|Once you do that, maybe I'll see you as Lady Tsubaki again.|Until then, you're still just a little girl.
speak;Tsubaki;Now, hold on--
expression;Ryuuji;CloseEyes
speak;Ryuuji;See ya later, Baki.

speak;Ryuuji;Oh, 'sup, Baki? What did ya need?
speak;Tsubaki;First of all, I will no longer tolerate that ridiculous nickname!|You must refer to me as "Lady Tsubaki" from now on.
expression;Ryuuji;HalfCloseEyes,Smile
speak;Ryuuji;Uh-huh?
speak;Tsubaki;A-And secondly, you may not be my retainer anymore,|but you are still a citizen of Merinas.|As such, you must recognize my authority as the imperial princess.
expression;Ryuuji;NormalBlink,Smile
speak;Ryuuji;Is that all?
speak;Tsubaki;Yes. I will not negotiate on these terms.
