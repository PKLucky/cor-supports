Ryuuji: I've been doing some thinking lately, and I think we should drop formalities now.
Tsubaki: What do you mean, Kenji?
Ryuuji: I'm not under your service anymore, so I don't see any reason to keep seeing you as my liege. You're just some little girl in my eyes now.
Tsubaki: P-Pardon?
Ryuuji: So, instead of "Lady Tsubaki", I'd say something like Tsuba or Baki would be more appropriate.
Tsubaki: Hold for a moment! What's with those nicknames? A-And more importantly, you may not be my retainer anymore, but I'm still next in line to the throne. There should still be some level of respect.
Ryuuji: You know what? You have a point. But, y'know, you gotta earn that respect.
Tsubaki: Earn it?
Ryuuji: Let's see you live up to being the emperor's daughter. Once you do that, maybe I'll see you as Lady Tsubaki again. Until then, you're still just a little girl.
Tsubaki: Now, hold on--
Ryuuji: See ya later, Baki.
(Ryuuji leaves the scene.)
Tsubaki: Oh, Kenji... I know he's always been rough around the edges, but being with that pirate crew made him worse! Still, his brashness has always had an appeal...

Tsubaki: Kenji, may I-- I mean, I must speak with you this instant!
Ryuuji: Oh, 'sup, Baki? What did ya need?
Tsubaki: First of all, I will no longer tolerate that ridiculous nickname! You must refer to me as "Lady Tsubaki" from now on.
Ryuuji: Uh-huh?
Tsubaki: A-And secondly, you may not be my retainer anymore, but you are still a citizen of Merinas. As such, you must recognize my authority as the imperial princess.
Ryuuji: Is that all?
Tsubaki: Yes. I will not negotiate on these terms.
Ryuuji: Heh. Well, you're trying at least. I'll give you that much.
Tsubaki: Then...?
Ryuuji: Still not enough. Gotta try harder than that, Baki. See ya.
(Ryuuji leaves the scene.)
Tsubaki: W-Wait a moment! *sigh* That man, I swear... Still, there must be something I can do. I can't let him walk over me like this any longer!
