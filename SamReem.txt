Sam: Oh, hi! WOW! You're hot!
Reem: Umm... thank you? You really shouldn't just blurt things out like that. It's... improper.
Sam: Sorry. I've always admired wyvern riders, and you have a gorgeous complexion.
Reem: Thank you, but could we get away from my looks? Please?
Sam: Sure. Sorry.
Reem: It's not you, it's just... It's a personal matter.
Sam: Care to indulge me at all?
Reem: Forrest used to compliment me when he and Princess Krista would come to visit Fuegsol.
Sam: I didn't know you and he were close. I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to cause any rifts.
Reem: We're not. At least, not anymore. I think? It's... complicated. I'm not sure where we stand, and he's not the easiest to reason with. But, let's change subjects. You said you admired wyvern riders. Why?
Sam: Ballads and stories made them out to be a terror to behold, almost like they were beyond human. And when I see you and Prince Khalid soar across the battlefield, it's spectacular!
Reem: I could take you for a ride sometime if you like.
Sam: ... I'll think about it.
Reem: Something wrong?
Sam: Just not sure if I would like not being on the ground is all.
Reem: You'll be fine. Trust me.

Sam: Hey, Reem! What are you up to?
Reem: Ah, Sam. A pleasure to see you. You just caught me before I set off to do patrols around the castle perimeter. Would you like to join me?
Sam: Sure!
Reem: Here, you can take a seat behind me on the saddle.
Sam: W-Wait, you mean you're gonna fly around?
Reem: Of course. The air provides a better view of the area. Not to mention it will be faster that way. And Aina here can handle our combined weight just fine. Right, Aina?
Wyvern: *Skree!*
Reem: Besides, my offer of taking you for a ride is still on the table. Unless you don't want to?
Sam: Well, I never said that. It's not that I don't like being above ground. ... I think? I dunno. I just want to be in charge of where my whole body's going, y'know?
Reem: Ah, I think I get it. How about I teach you how to fly, then? Give you a hands-on lesson? You'll be in control of the reins, but I'll still be there to make sure we don't make any crash landings.
Sam: Hm... I guess that'll be fine.
Reem: Alright, let's go!
