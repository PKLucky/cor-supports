Parker: Ah, Krista. Would you like to play a round or two of chess? It's been a while since we last played.
Krista: Sure! And I'm gonna win this time. I'm wayyy smarter than I was years ago. I've got totally flawless strategies up my sleeve.
Parker: We'll see about that.
(Scene transitions to the castle library.)
Krista, thinking: Okay, so we've got a bunch of pawns here, a bunch of pawns there, both of us still got our queens, but he's down a knight, so...
Krista: Hmmmmmm...
Parker: So, about those "flawless strategies"...
Krista: Shh! I'm focused. So focused.
Parker: Practically locked onto the board.
Krista: Yup!
Parker: So locked on that you haven't made your move yet.
Krista: Give me a second! ... There. Perfect position for my bishop.
Parker: Are you sure about that?
Krista: What are you--Nooooo, you gotta be kidding me...!
Parker: So, you see it too. I'll go ahead with the move we're both seeing, then. There goes that bishop.
Krista: Fine, whatever. It's just one bishop. I can totally bounce back from this!
Parker: With your "flawless strategy"?
Krista: You get it!
(Several moves later...)
Parker: And that's checkmate.
Krista: Man...
Parker: Good game, Krista. Your move-by-move analysis of the board has improved since our last game years ago.
Krista: Really?
Parker: Mm-hm. At any rate, I have important business to attend to, so we'll leave it at that. See you later, Krista. Don't cause too much trouble out there.

Krista: Why do you only act like that when it's just me around?
Parker: Because if you told anyone this is how I am in private, no one would ever believe you.
Krista: ... Oh Medea, I hate that you're right.
