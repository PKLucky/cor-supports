[Premise: Parker has a more lax personality when in private and Krista is the only person who knows this.]
Krista: Why do you only act like that when it’s just me around?
Parker: Because if you told anyone this is how I am in private, no one would ever believe you.
Krista: … Oh Medea, I hate that you’re right.
Parker: At any rate, I have important business to attend to.
(Insert CG of Parker giving Krista a head pat here?)
Parker: Don’t cause too much trouble out there, Krista.
(Parker leaves.)
Krista: Wha– Hey! *sigh* That guy…
