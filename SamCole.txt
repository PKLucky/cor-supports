Sam: Hey! You there! Kid!
Cole: Huh? What? Uh, yes...? May I help you?
Sam: What do you think you're doing?
Cole: Uh... Studying magic?
Sam: See, that's your FIRST problem. Magic is absolutely useless out there on the battlefield.
Cole: Huh? What are you talking about? I've seen the mages in this army make great contributions in combat.
Sam: A REAL man goes out there and takes on his enemies head-on! Only cowards use stinkin' MAGIC to fight their battles.
Cole: Mister Parker isn't a coward. He's one of the bravest people I know.
Sam: Pfft-- Sure. Look, kid, you need a new perspective on what it means to be a REAL man. And I can show you!
Cole: What.
Sam: To the training yard! I'm teaching you how to swing an axe!
Cole: Huh? Wha--
(Sam drags Cole offscreen.)
Cole: WAIT!
