Yumi: (Oh it’s a priest- Wait, Maybe I could get some information.) Sup- Hello!
Hikaru: Good Morning. What purpose have you come to see me?
Yumi: (There’s no way this is this easy.) What’s it like being a-uh- A Worshipping of Merin- The Merin Church?
Hikaru: I can answer that.
Yumi: Ah, thank you.
Hikaru: Okay, first of all Oathbreaking will not get you anywhere.
(Some hours later)
Hikaru: And it was called Merin. Anything else? (She’s fallen asleep.)
Yumi: Oh- Oh, yeah that’s nice. (That was boring. Maybe I should do something else.)
Hikaru: Are you okay? You seem like you weren’t paying attention
Yumi: (moves around Hikaru)  Oh I’m fine, I was paying attention. If… we can talk some other time, there’s some more stuff I’d like to talk about- ButNotNow! (If I have to spend another half hour here I’m gonna go mad.)
Hikaru: Farewell. (Sighs) (What am I going to do?)

Hikaru: You forgot your book. 
Villager: Thank you
Hikaru: You’re welcome.
Yumi: Oh hey Hiki~~ how are you? (steals the book from the villager)
Hikaru: Eh? Give that back!
Villager: Oh, thanks again. I didn’t know she was there.
(Villager actually leaves)
Yumi: So we were going to talk about something, right?
Hikaru: Yes-
Yumi: Good. (Moves closer) Let’s go to the pub, It’ll be fun Hiki~.
Hikaru: I’m sorry, If I go I might-
Yumi: (Moves his arm onto her chest) That stuff isn’t important~! (And it’s rather boring too.)
Hikaru: I apologize the answer is still no.
Yumi: If you do I’ll promise I’ll listen to more of your worship.
Hikaru: Stop this. Or else I’ll have to silence you.
Yumi: Oh~ Silence me? Well I woul-
Villager: Just thought I’d thank again, this is the Fourth time I’d- Nevermind.
(The Villagers appearance causes Yumi to let go of Hikaru)
Yumi: (Damn it! I’m getting nowhere right now.) Don’t worry I’ll be going. (Yumi leaves)
Hikaru: No, thank you. (Something has to be done about her.)

Hikaru: Well, he’s not a foolish as he seems. I don’t know why he’s like this
