speak;Sam;You're pretty good for your age, Michael.|However, unlike a sword or a spear where you can easily recover from a miss,|an axe is a momentum weapon.
speak;Michael;How so, Mister Sam?
speak;Sam;If you miss a lance strike, you can retract it quickly.|An axe, however, once you set it in motion, you have to follow through.
speak;Michael;So, if I can see the path it's on,|I can then tell where it will go next?
expression;Sam;Smile
speak;Sam;Right on! You're doing good, kid.|I'll see you around.
