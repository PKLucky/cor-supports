Tsubaki: Um, excuse me, Lord Masashi?
Masashi: Ah, Lady Tsubaki! What a pleasure it is for you to grace me with your presence.
Tsubaki: Oh, um, yes. It's... er... good to see you too.
Masashi: Did you need something of me? I know that seeing your lovely face has already made my day brighter.
Tsubaki: Um, actually...
Masashi: I must say, it is truly a miraculous occasion to have a private moment with you, Lady Tsubaki. In fact, why don't we chat over a cup of tea? I know this one cafe nearby that--
Tsubaki: You know what, I just remembered that I had some other business to attend to.
Masashi: Oh, really? Well, perhaps we could--
Tsubaki: I-I'm sorry, Lord Masashi. Maybe we can talk some other time. S-Sorry!
(Tsubaki leaves)
Masashi: L-Lady Tsubaki? Did I do something wrong? I feel like I barely got a word in.
(Scene change)
Tsubaki: So the rumors were true. He is nothing but a shameless flirt! *sigh* I was hoping that maybe he was different. Perhaps that was why Father said to stay away from him.

Masashi: Lady Tsubaki! So good to see you again. I feared that you have been avoiding me lately.
Tsubaki: Well...
Masashi: ... Ah. That IS the case, isn't it? 
Tsubaki: W-Wait, it's just--
Masashi: Please, say no more. I completely understand.
Tsubaki: You do?
Masashi: I see that my reputation has preceded me. But I assure you that there will be none of that today. I apologize if I was too bold during our first conversation.
Tsubaki: Oh. But still, I'm not sure if I can trust you to keep your word. I'm sorry. 
Masashi: Don't be. Like I said, I can understand your hesitancy. But, I would like to get to know you more, Lady Tsubaki. Truly. It's just that I wasn't allowed to talk about you or even meet up with you before.
Tsubaki: Wait, why weren't you allowed to see me? Other than my father having your head if you did?
Masashi: I'm not exactly sure, but I do have my theories.
Tsubaki: Oh?
Masashi: On one hand, I may be biased on this conclusion considering who it involves. But at the same time, I don't see any other possibilities.
Tsubaki: Who are you thinking of, Lord Masashi?
Masashi: Before we tackle that, let us make sure we're on the same page about something first. Emperor Samegoro had someone in mind for you to wed when the time came, yes?
Tsubaki: Of course. The arrangement was decided around ten years ago, I believe. Though, now that you mention it, the marriage was called off only a couple years afterward.
Masashi: Lady Tsubaki, I was the one you would have been wed to.
Tsubaki: Y-You?! I-I mean, no offense, Lord Masashi, but my father hated you. At least, I thought he did. Why would he have considered you as a possible marriage candidate in the first place?
Masashi: I believe there was someone who was pulling strings here. Someone who wanted to keep me away from you. No, keep me away from ANYONE. I... I can't think of anyone else who it could be.
Tsubaki: Who is it?
Masashi: It's... It's one of the strategists who worked under my father. She was my tutor and practically my caretaker since my parents were always busy with political matters. And just having a connection to my family was enough to have some amount of influence.
Tsubaki: Hm... I can see how she could do this, but WHY would she? Your family has great military prowess and influence over the northeastern region of Merinas. If anything, our union would only be a benefit. I'm sure anyone who has some insight into political affairs can see that. So, why...?
Masashi: ...
Tsubaki: Lord Masashi?
Masashi: I... I'm sorry, Lady Tsubaki. I... I can't...
Tsubaki: Lord Masashi...?
Masashi: I-I have to go. I apologize. I just... I'm sorry!
(Masashi leaves.)
Tsubaki: Ah, wait! ... Lord Masashi, what happened to you...?

Tsubaki: Masashi, get back here!
Masashi: Greetings Lady Tsubaki.
Tsubaki: You've been avoiding me. What hell's up with you?
Masashi: I'm fine, there's nothing wrong with me other than being a dumb oaf.
Tsubaki: There must be a reason why you became a “dumb oaf”, there's no way you're actually like that! Also you're so awkward.
Masashi: H-how about you? Tell me about you.
Tsubaki: Other than the stuff I may or may have not explained (breathes). Most of the people around me leave me and my dad watches over me like a hawk. (He mentioned me being in an arranged marriage. Maybe I could use that.) A week or two ago you mentioned me being in an arranged marriage. The arranged marriage was in the plans for 10 years, the person I was to marry was you. Our dads were really close so a marriage would be very beneficial. But when I was eleven-and-a-half the marriage was called off.
Masashi: I never knew that we were to be married.
Tsubaki: Why didn't you know? When I saw your parents they seemed pretty excited about it.
Masashi: I said before that my parents were almost never around- they just left me with a Governess most of the-
Tsubaki: You aren't leaving
Masashi: Her name was Emi, she wasn't very nice. She yelled at me a lot, but she gave me a lot of kisses whenever I did something she approved of, but I think she used that to keep me under control. She didn't seem to like you at all, she told me to not talk about or even meet up with you. The only time I was free from her was during archery class.
Tsubaki: That explains a lot. But don't worry, you haven't seen her since…
Masashi: I was twelve.
Tsubaki: Yeah, and you're a noble. I'm pretty sure you'll find someone… if you stop acting like a shameless flirt.
Masashi: I am thinking of renouncing noble status. I have failed way too many times.
