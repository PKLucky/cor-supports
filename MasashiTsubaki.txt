Tsubaki: Um, excuse me, Lord Masashi?
Masashi: Ah, Lady Tsubaki! What a pleasure it is for you to grace me with your presence.
Tsubaki: Oh, um, yes. It's... er... good to see you too.
Masashi: Did you need something of me? I know that seeing your lovely face has already made my day brighter.
Tsubaki: Um, actually...
Masashi: I must say, it is truly a miraculous occasion to have a private moment with you, Lady Tsubaki. In fact, why don't we chat over a cup of tea? I know this one cafe nearby that--
Tsubaki: You know what, I just remembered that I had some other business to attend to.
Masashi: Oh, really? Well, perhaps we could--
Tsubaki: I-I'm sorry, Lord Masashi. Maybe we can talk some other time. S-Sorry!
(Tsubaki leaves)
Masashi: L-Lady Tsubaki? Did I do something wrong? I feel like I barely got a word in.
(Scene change)
Tsubaki: So the rumors were true. He is nothing but a shameless flirt! *sigh* I was hoping that maybe he was different. Perhaps that was why Father said to stay away from him.

Masashi: Lady Tsubaki! So good to see you again. I feared that you have been avoiding me lately.
Tsubaki: Well...
Masashi: ... Ah. That IS the case, isn't it? 
Tsubaki: W-Wait, it's just--
Masashi: Please, say no more. I completely understand.
Tsubaki: You do?
Masashi: I see that my reputation has preceded me. But I assure you that there will be none of that today. I apologize if I was too bold during our first conversation.
Tsubaki: Oh. But still, I'm not sure if I can trust you to keep your word. I'm sorry.
Masashi: Don't be. Like I said, I can understand your hesitancy. But, I would like to get to know you more, Lady Tsubaki. Truly. It's just that I wasn't allowed to talk about you or even meet up with you before.
Tsubaki: Wait, why weren't you allowed to see me? Other than my father having your head if you did?
Masashi: I'm not exactly sure, but I do have my theories.
Tsubaki: Oh?
Masashi: On one hand, I may be biased on this conclusion considering who it involves. But at the same time, I don't see any other possibilities.
Tsubaki: Who are you thinking of, Lord Masashi?
Masashi: Before we tackle that, let us make sure we're on the same page about something first. Emperor Samegoro had someone in mind for you to wed when the time came, yes?
Tsubaki: Of course. The arrangement was decided around ten years ago, I believe. Though, now that you mention it, the marriage was called off only a couple years afterward.
Masashi: Lady Tsubaki, I was the one you would have been wed to.
Tsubaki: Y-You?! I-I mean, no offense, Lord Masashi, but my father hated you. At least, I thought he did. Why would he have considered you as a possible marriage candidate in the first place?
Masashi: I believe there was someone who was pulling strings here. Someone who wanted to keep me away from you. No, keep me away from ANYONE. I... I can't think of anyone else who it could be.
Tsubaki: Who is it?
Masashi: It's... It's one of the strategists who worked under my father. She was my tutor and practically my caretaker since my parents were always busy with political matters. And just having a connection to my family was enough to have some amount of influence.
Tsubaki: Hm... I can see how she could do this, but WHY would she? Your family has great military prowess and influence over the northeastern region of Merinas. If anything, our union would only be a benefit. I'm sure anyone who has some insight into political affairs can see that. So, why...?
Masashi: ...
Tsubaki: Lord Masashi?
Masashi: I... I'm sorry, Lady Tsubaki. I... I can't...
Tsubaki: Lord Masashi...?
Masashi: I-I have to go. I apologize. I just... I'm sorry!
(Masashi leaves.)
Tsubaki: Ah, wait! ... Lord Masashi, what happened to you...?

Tsubaki: Masashi, get back here!
Masashi: Greetings, Lady Tsubaki. I was just about to leave.
Tsubaki: You've been avoiding me. What's up with you?
Masashi: I'm fine. There's nothing wrong with me other than being a dumb oaf.
Tsubaki: There must be a reason why you became a "dumb oaf". There's no way you're actually like that! Also, you're so awkward.
Masashi: H-how about you? Tell me about you.
Tsubaki: Well... Most of the people around me leave me, and my father watches over me like a hawk, and said father had but put under control. Now tell me, if your caregiver was isolating you from everyone else. How did you find out about the marriage?
Masashi: My parents told me about it, but she insisted I didn't need to know.
Tsubaki: What was her name? I don't think we'll get anywhere if we just call her "her" or "she" and what happened most of the time?
Masashi: Well, sorry again… I have to go.
Tsubaki: You aren't leaving.
Masashi: Her name was Emi, she wasn't very nice. She yelled at me a lot, but she gave me a lot of kisses whenever I did something she approved of, but I think she used that to keep me under control. She didn't seem to like you at all, she told me to not talk about or even meet up with you. The only time I was free from her was during archery class.
Tsubaki: That explains a lot. But don't worry, if we find her, she'll be arrested…
Masashi: When I was twelve someone saw us kissing, her reaction was to run away. I haven't seen her since then. I wasn't sure what to do when she never- The only thing I had other than that was archery.
Tsubaki: Don't worry about it! Don't let it get to you, she's a bad person. And you're a noble. I'm pretty sure you'll find someone... if you stop acting like a shameless flirt.
Masashi: I am thinking of renouncing noble status- What am I saying? No! I must not let anything like that happen again!
Tsubaki: That's good, keep up the positive self-talk.
Masashi: I need to move on from her, she still has dominion over me. But I would like to know about staff training.
