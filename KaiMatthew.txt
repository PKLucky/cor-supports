Kai and Matthew 
Kai: “Hey you!
Matthew: Who me?
Kai: Yes you. You’re not from around here are you?
Matthew: Not exactly, why do you ask?
Kai: I tend to keep tabs on things and have quite the network of intel so I know you’re not native to Medea and I’m damn sure you’re not from Merinas either. So where are you from?
Matthew: Not too sure myself but it’s far away from here, quite far.
Kai: Ever heard the name Circ?
Matthew: Can’t say I have? Why is that the capital of some place?
Kai: Not important.
