Joshua: Krista! I got a proposition for ya!
Krista: What's up, Joshua?
Joshua: Y'see, I've been observing your sword techniques, and I think I can help you get even better at handling swords.
Krista: Oh? What did you have in mind?
Joshua: So, your defenses and speed are good. Nothing wrong there. What you DO need more of is raw strength.
Krista: And a big, strong, buff man like you is gonna get me all big, strong, and buff?
Joshua: You get it! How about we get the ball rolling now?
Krista: I'm down! So, what sort of training do I gotta do?
Joshua: No, no, no. We can't train 'til we get more muscle on ya. And to do that, we gotta get some food in you to fuel them!
Krista: H-Huh?!
Joshua: To the dining hall, Krista! Let's go, let's go!!
(Joshua drags Krista offscreen.)
Krista: Wait! I just had lunch!! I can't eat anymore! WAIT!!!

Joshua: So, how do you feel? Feel the burn?
Krista: I feel something burning, alright.
Joshua: Great! That just means you're making progress.
Krista: Joshua, I won't doubt your methods, but I feel like I'm literally gonna explode. Or collapse. Or both. No, yeah, definitely both.
Joshua: No problem. We can take a break and pick things up tomorrow--
Krista: Could you hold that thought? Collapsing and exploding incoming.
Joshua: Wait, what--
(Krista collapses.)
Joshua: Krista?! You okay??
Krista: Urgh......
Joshua: Yeesh, that ain't good. Uh, let's pick things up in a few days instead?
Krista: Sure. As long as you can carry me to my room. Please?
Joshua: Deal.

Joshua: So, Krista, how do you feel about your progress so far?
Krista: Pretty good, actually! You see these biceps? BAM! And these shoulders? POW! And this ass? OH YEAH!
Joshua: We never specifically worked on your ass.
Krista: I know. I just wanted to point it out.
Joshua: Seriously though, I have been seeing a lot of improvement. Keep this up, and you'll be covered in muscles!
Krista: Yeah!
Joshua: And maybe you'll be able to use Old Iron one day.
Krista: You think so? Mind if I give it a try now?
Joshua: Now? Oh, sure, why not. Here, I'll lay it on the ground like this.
(Joshua sets the sword down.)
Joshua: Go for it!
Krista: Here I go!
(Krista tries to lift it.)
Krista: Hnnnnng!! Hurk! Gah...!
Joshua: Can't say I didn't expect that. Good try, though! Hup!
(Joshua picks up the sword.)
Krista: Man, you can do that so easily. I wanna do that one day.
Joshua: Keep bulking up and training hard, then. It'll take time, but who knows? Maybe you will be able to pick up Old Iron.
Krista: Yeah! Anyway, thanks for letting me try out Old Iron. I'll see you around!
(Krista leaves the scene.)
Joshua: She does have a nice ass, though. Maybe... Nah, she'd never. She's the princess of Medeas for crying out loud!

Krista: Hey, Joshua! So, what did you want to show me?
Joshua: Hey, Krista! Here it is!
Krista: Whoa, cool sword.
Joshua: Yup, and it's all yours.
Krista: Wait, for me?
Joshua: Yup. It's just like Old Iron, but you-sized.
Krista: Aw, you didn't have to do that. But thank you, Joshua. This is really cool! Do you mind if I give it a try?
Joshua: Hey, it's meant for you. Do whatever you want with it!
Krista: Alright, here we go!
(Krista swings the sword around.)
Krista: Whew, not bad! It's got heft to it, but it's a LOT more manageable than Old Iron was.
Joshua: So, gonna take it?
Krista: Yeah! Thanks again, Joshua.
