Viola: There you are, Mello. A nice juicy apple for you. I even sprinkled some sugar on it just for you.
Mello: Neigh!
Viola: There you are! Who's my favorite girl? Who's my favorite girl? YOU'RE my favorite girl!
(Masashi enters the scene.)
Masashi: Oh magnificent heavens, who is this perfect example of grace, poise, and loveliness?
Viola: Huh? Who are you?
Masashi: Oh, did I startle you, madam? I'm dreadfully sorry. I am Masashi, a shogun of Merinas. I just couldn't stay silent after seeing the grace and poise you possess. Especially after seeing how you look after your steed.
Viola: Uhhhh... Thank you?
Masashi: Oh my, graceful AND humble? Madam, you are a diamond amongst rubble, mere coal even. Would you be interested in a pot of tea later? Perhaps around lunch?
Viola: Sure! I'd love to.
Mello: NEIGH!!! Neigh neigh neigh!!!!
Masashi: Even your pegasus has gotten excited. I'll see you later, then. Until next time.
(Masashi leaves the scene.)
Viola: He seems nice. Hm... Tea would be good. I hope there's plenty of sugar.
Mello: NEIGH!
Viola: What's that, girl?
Mello: Neigh! Neigh!!
Viola: Now, that's not very nice to say. We don't even know him to know if that's true or not.
Mello: Neeighhh. Neigh, neigh. Neigh!
Viola: Wait, what? Mello, please! He just wants to have tea and maybe some biscuits or something.
Mello: Neigh!
Viola: It's not that serious!
Mello: NEIGH!!
Viola: Will you stop worrying?!
