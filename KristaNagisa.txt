Krista: Gotta admit, “floozy”’s a new one. Never really thought myself as one, but I guess if you got to know me more, you’d find it fitting.
Nagisa: I... What the hell is wrong with you?
Krista: So much. You don’t even know the half of it.
Nagisa: ...
Krista: So, got any more insults for me that I’ve already told myself, or are you good?
Nagisa: Uh. I think I’ll just go.
Krista: ‘Kay, see ya!
Nagisa: ...

Nagisa: Hey, we need to talk.
Krista: Oh, hey, Nagisa! What’s up?
Nagisa: Can you please stop smiling like that? It’s weirding me out.
Krista: What d’ya mean?
Nagisa: Don’t play dumb! I’ve been nothing but an ass to you since we’ve met and you’ve been all smiles around me despite that. Can’t you be... I dunno, angry? I’d prefer that over whatever act you’re trying to pull.
Krista: I’m not acting, though. I just don’t see a point in being angry over something like this.
Nagisa: Huh?
Krista: I don’t like being angry, Nagisa. It can be scary, y’know? If I let myself get mad at every little thing, someone’s gonna get hurt.
Nagisa: Yeah, well, not being angry at ANYTHING is weird too. If someone’s treating you wrong or if something doesn’t go your way, you have every right to get mad.
Krista: I guess that’s true. Still, I don’t wanna act upon it if I don’t have to. I don’t wanna hurt someone for no good reason.
Nagisa: At least have some semblance of standing up for yourself! By Merin, just what kind of leader lets themselves get walked all over by their subordinates, huh? As meek as Lady Tsubaki is, at least she’s TRYING to be assertive.
Krista: I get it, Nagisa. I really do, but...
Nagisa: But what? C’mon, spit it out already.
Krista: I can’t let myself succumb to my anger again.
Nagisa: What are you--
Krista: ...! Sh-Shoot, I... I gotta go!
(Krista leaves the scene.)
Nagisa: What the hell was that all about?

Nagisa: If you weren’t the Medean princess, no one would even like you.
Krista: Yeah, I know.
Nagisa: Wh- You weren’t supposed to agree with that!
Krista: Why wouldn’t I? It’s true.
Nagisa: You agreeing with me is even more irritating. What’s wrong with you?!
Krista: Where do I even start? I’m impulsive, crude, childish, I drag other people into my own messes, I-
Nagisa: Okay, okay, stop it already! You’re just making me feel bad now.
Krista: Doesn’t feel good, does it?
Nagisa: …!
Krista: I’m not offended by what you said. Just putting that out there. Every insult you’ve hurled at me… I actually do think of myself like that. If anything, I’m glad someone else sees it too.
Nagisa: Y-You…! Argh! Everything about you is so damn annoying!
Krista: Yup. Already established that.
Nagisa: Shut up! Just… whatever! I’m done here.

A Support (OLD)
Nagisa: How dare you be happy with him?!
Krista: Is that what this is about? Nagisa, Kai's just my retainer. Nothing more. I don't know him beyond the duties he's fulfilled. Honestly, even now, it feels like he's just out of arm's reach. 
Nagisa: What? But…
Krista: I don't know what you see, but I think I finally get it. Nagisa. You love Kai, don't you?
Nagisa: Y-You… You…! Don’t you dare look at me like that! That piteous look on your face… I hate it! And I hate you too! Acting all high and mighty just because you make some stupid assumption…
Krista: …
Nagisa: … What?
Krista: Go on. I'm letting you say your piece. You're trying to prove me wrong, right?

Krista: At least they're alive.
Nagisa: What are you getting at?
Krista: Do you know of the former crown prince of Fuegsol? Prince Ervan?
Nagisa: What about him?
Krista: He was my fiancee. We were to be married around a year ago. But then… Well, you know.
Nagisa: …
Krista: He left so suddenly. And now, all I have are words left unsaid.
Nagisa: What would you say to him if you could?
Krista: … “I still love you. Despite everything.”
Nagisa: …
Krista: Try not to think about it. After all, those words would be for him to hear. He'd know what I mean.
Nagisa: R-Right.
Krista: But back to the point I was trying to make. You still have a chance to mend those bridges, Nagisa. If you want to take the opportunity, great. If you don't, that's fine too. Just don't make a decision you'll regret later.
Nagisa: I understand. … Your Highness?
Krista: Oh. Uh. Yeah?
Nagisa: Sorry. About everything.
Krista: Heh. Don't sweat it. Really.
