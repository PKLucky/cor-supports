Felicity: You need to move. I'm trying to clean this room, and you're in my way.
Nagisa: Oh, you're HER servant. Miss Floozy’s personal maid. For someone in servitude, you have quite the mouth. Why, if--
Felicity: Let's get one thing straight, hussy. I am TOLERATING your presence in the MEDEAN castle. But if I hear one more word of disrespect, or you sullying Her Highness' name, I will remove you from existence.
Nagisa: Are you threatening me? 
Felicity: Who, little ol' me? Goodness, no. I'm not threatening you, dear.
(Felicity moves closer)
Felicity: Now, get out of my way and behave yourself. I am very good at removing rats from Her Highness' chambers, so I suggest you heed my warning. However, it would give me great pleasure if you ignored it anyway. So please, by all means, continue being a pile of rubbish. I will gladly take you out with the rest of the trash.
(Felicity leaves)
Nagisa: Who does she think she is, speaking to me as though she's on the same footing! She's a mere servant. A nobody! Of all the nerve... Still, I can't shake the feeling that she meant and can do exactly as she said. Who is she? There’s no way she’s just a maid. There was something about her eyes. Something feral. Did she used to be a mercenary or assassin?
