speak;Asuka;When did you pick up that insufferable attitude?

speak;Asuka;{tgm}...{c:expression;Asuka;CloseEyes}{tgm} You are just trying to distract me.|I will not give in so easily.

Asuka: …
Kai: What's wrong, Asuka? Given up?
Asuka: … Why…? Why do you have to be so much like him?
Kai: Asuka… *sigh* Alright, this is just getting sad. You've gotta let him go. Yuuto’s gone, and I ain’t here to replace him.
Asuka: “Let him go”? You expect me to just “let him go”? I can't do that, Kai. Yuuto was… He… You can't even begin to understand how I feel!
Kai: Hmph. You're right. I can't. I'll never understand how you can still love him that deeply after what happened. He got careless, Asuka. He's a failure. An absolute failure of a father…!
Asuka: Kai? … Oh, Kai…
(Asuka attempts to pull Kai into an embrace)
Kai: Don't touch me. Yuuto is gone. I don't care about him anymore and you shouldn't either. So just stop it already.
Asuka: You can hide your feelings all you want, but you can’t hide them from me. I’ve known you all your life, Kai.

Kai: He shouldn't have died like that, Asuka. He was better than that! He… He was…
Asuka: I know, Kai. I know.
Kai: … Asuka?
Asuka: Yes?
Kai: Do not tell anyone of this.
Asuka: Of course.

Kai: For the record, I was NOT gonna follow through on my offer from a while back. I have standards.
Asuka: Well, that disproves a certain rumor I heard about you.
Kai: Huh? And what rumor might that be?
Asuka: I wonder if I should tell you? Maybe not. It'll be for your own peace of mind.
Kai: With how you phrased that, maybe I SHOULD know.
Asuka: I'm sure you won't have to worry about it, being under the Medean princess’s service now. Besides, ninjas are trained to keep their secrets. You said so yourself.
Kai: Don't use my words against me like that…
Asuka: Haha!
Kai: *sigh* … Asuka?
Asuka: Hm?
Kai: I missed this.
Asuka: I did too.
Kai: Hey, when this is all over, will you still try to kill me?
Asuka: I have a duty to fulfill, so I'll chase you down wherever you end up. Whether or not you survive comes down to your own abilities.
Kai: Heh, fine by me. Prepare for a lifelong pursuit, Asuka.
Asuka: I wouldn't have it any other way, Kai.
