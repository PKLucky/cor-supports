Asuka: ...
(Asuka sneaks behind Kai and pins him to the wall.)
Asuka: Got you.
Kai: Nice to see you too, Asuka.
Asuka: You know very well what the consequences are for defecting, Kai. And as much as I would like to follow through with them, I can't exactly do that.
Kai: Aw, you still care about me.
Asuka: When did you pick up that insufferable attitude?
Kai: It's always been there. I was just good at hiding it. Now, are you gonna keep holding me like this, or should I just break free myself?
Asuka: Wha--
(Kai breaks out of Asuka's grasp.)
Kai: You couldn't have honestly believed I wouldn't know how to break out of that hold. It was my father's technique. You know that.
Asuka: I suppose I underestimated you. I assumed you'd be rusty after all this time.
Kai: So, what's the deal, Asuka? I'm sure getting your hands on me wasn't the reason for your "visit". Heh, unless...
Asuka: Now, hold on--
Kai: I mean, I know I look like my old man, but come on--
Asuka: Quiet already!
Kai: Hmm, not hearing you deny it.
Asuka: ... You are just trying to distract me. I will not give in so easily.
Kai: Whatever makes you feel better.
Asuka: This was just a warning, Kai. Once our time with the Medean princess is over, I will not show you mercy. Watch yourself.
(Asuka leaves the scene.)
Kai: Man, I know I was just trying to rile her up, but... Hm... That's just plain pitiful, Asuka.

Asuka: ... 
(Asuka sneaks up behind Kai, but he turns around before she can get closer.)
Asuka: !!
Kai: I'm not playing around anymore, Asuka. Gonna have to try harder than that.
Asuka: Why, you...! Ya!
(Asuka moves in to strike Kai, but he dodges.)
Kai: Hey, what happened to not killing me, hm?
Asuka: You're making me reconsider, Kai. Choose your next words carefully.
Kai: ... "Good job, Su-chan. You've really improved."
Asuka: ...! D-Don't... Don't call me that.
Kai: What's wrong? I thought you would've missed being called by that nickname.
Asuka: ...
Kai: If you want me to keep going, I can. In fact, I'll even throw in my "services" if you feel so inclined.
Asuka: You cannot be serious.
Kai: Wouldn't be offering if I wasn't. He and I went through similar training. You know that. I bet I look just like him in his prime. Just a little bit of gold, and you can see for yourself, Asuka.
Asuka: ... Even you can admit this is going too far, Kai.
Kai: Maybe. But your hesitation is giving me mixed signals. Think about it. No one will know but us. Keeping secrets is literally what ninjas are trained to do, after all.
Asuka: Do not tempt me.
Kai: So, it is up for consideration, then?
Asuka: ... No. Goodbye, Kai.
(Asuka leaves the scene.)
Kai: Damn, so close. Hmm... but even if she did accept, would I really have it in me to follow through on it? ... Ugh, just thinking about pretending to be him is making me sick...

Asuka: ...
Kai: What's wrong, Asuka? Given up?
Asuka: ... Why...? Why do you have to be so much like him?
Kai: Asuka... *sigh* Alright, this is just getting sad. You've gotta let him go. Yuuto's gone, and I ain't here to replace him.
Asuka: "Let him go"? You expect me to just "let him go"? I can't do that, Kai. Yuuto was... He... You can't even begin to understand how I feel!
Kai: Hmph. You're right. I can't. I'll never understand how you can still love him that deeply after what happened. He got careless, Asuka. He's a failure. An absolute failure of a father...!
Asuka: Kai? ... Oh, Kai...
(Asuka attempts to pull Kai into an embrace)
Kai: Don't touch me. Yuuto is gone. I don't care about him anymore and you shouldn't either. So just stop it already.
Asuka: You can hide your feelings all you want, but you can't hide them from me. I've known you all your life, Kai.

Kai: He shouldn't have died like that, Asuka. He was better than that! He... He was...
Asuka: I know, Kai. I know.
Kai: ... Asuka?
Asuka: Yes?
Kai: Do not tell anyone of this.
Asuka: Of course.

Kai: For the record, I was NOT gonna follow through on my offer from a while back. I have standards.
Asuka: Well, that disproves a certain rumor I heard about you.
Kai: Huh? And what rumor might that be?
Asuka: I wonder if I should tell you? Maybe not. It'll be for your own peace of mind.
Kai: With how you phrased that, maybe I SHOULD know.
Asuka: I'm sure you won't have to worry about it, being under the Medean princess' service now. Besides, ninjas are trained to keep their secrets. You said so yourself.
Kai: Don't use my words against me like that...
Asuka: Haha!
Kai: *sigh* ... Asuka?
Asuka: Hm?
Kai: I missed this.
Asuka: I did too.
Kai: Hey, when this is all over, will you still try to kill me?
Asuka: I have a duty to fulfill, so I'll chase you down wherever you end up. Whether or not you survive comes down to your own abilities.
Kai: Heh, fine by me. Prepare for a lifelong pursuit, Asuka.
Asuka: I wouldn't have it any other way, Kai.
