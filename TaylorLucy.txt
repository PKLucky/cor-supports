Lucy: Umm Mr. Taylor sir? 
Taylor: Hmm? Oh hi Lucy how's the army's Number 1 Healer doing?
Lucy: I'm good, except I'm not number 1 my mom is
Taylor: Oh of course number 2 then, still a really good healer we're all glad you're filling in for your mom
Lucy: Thanks! It's fun and I'm learning a lot one day I'll be as good as mom
Taylor: I'm sure of it
Lucy: Then I'll be the second number 1 healer
Taylor: You can't have two number 1's...1,2
Lucy: Sure you can mom is number one, number one I'll be number two number one
Taylor: ....That...makes no sense but what did you want?
Lucy: Oh yeah! So sometimes after you and the guys go out after training the next day some of them are in the infirmary groaning something awful
Taylor: .....huh....strange....really...strange
Lucy: I know right? Even weirder is that they have no injuries no cuts or bruises and they seem fine after someone uses a restore staff specifically
Taylor: ....weird...
Lucy: I was wondering...what DO you and the guys do when you go to the town after training sometimes
Taylor: Oh nothing much just talking shop over a few drinks together
Lucy: Drinks? Like Apple Juice?
Taylor: Exactly! ADULT apple Juice
Lucy: Adult Apple Juice? What's that?
Taylor: It's Apple Juice...for Adults!
