??? Hi there!
Michael: Huh? Who said that?
Lucy comes rushing in
Lucy: I did. I’m Lucy!
Michael: You’re a girl
Lucy: Yup! Oh you’re a knight right?
Michael: Uh….yeah?
Lucy! Oh then I should call you Sir Michael then!
Michael: I really don’t think that’s necessary
Lucy: But…..I call Forrest, Sir Forrest. Taylor, Sir Taylor and they’re both knights
Michael: Yes but that’s different.
Lucy: How come?
Michael: It just is
Lucy: Oh why’d you become a knight Sir Michael
Michae smiles: Ha-ha. Please just call me Michael. Sir Michael is embarrassing I haven’t done anything deserving of being called Sir
Lucy: But you’re a knight! And you’re so strong! You protect people!
Michael: Oh there’s plenty of people a lot stronger than I am
Lucy: Like who? Besides Sir Forrest, Sir Taylor, Lady Alex, Princess Kirsta, Lady Chell……..ok maybe that is a lot of people
Michael: Ha-hal It’s ok, it just means I have a long way to go but until then I’m going to do my best
Lucy: Yeah! Me too, well maybe not at protecting people like you do but I’m going to become the best healer ever!
Michael: I’ll do my best to keep you safe so you can become the best healer Lucy
Lucy: And I’ll patch you up if you get hurt!
