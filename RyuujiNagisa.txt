Nagisa: You… You kept the Wyrmfang Pirates away from the capital this whole time.
Ryuuji: And first prize goes to the lovely lady. Didn’t you find it strange that the raids just suddenly stopped?
Nagisa: I did, but I didn’t think you were responsible for that. Kenji. We thought you were dead! Why would we even think of that possibility?
Ryuuji: I thought you’d make the connection after you saw I was still alive and kickin’. Seriously, you’re smarter than that, Nagisa. Use that head of yours.
Nagisa: You… never stopped thinking of us.
Ryuuji: You guys are family. Getting kidnapped by pirates ain’t gonna change that.
Nagisa: I–We missed you so much, Kenji.
Ryuuji: I know. I’m sorry. After the old captain kicked the bucket, someone had to take over the crew. And I just happened to be the man for the job. I had new responsibilities to take care of.
Nagisa: You just can’t escape being everyone’s father figure, can you?
Ryuuji: Heh, you can say that again.
Nagisa: … So, you returning to Edoyama is…
Ryuuji: Next to impossible.
Nagisa: What if Lady Tsubaki took your crew into the imperial navy?
Ryuuji: Nah, they're too free-spirited for that. Too many of us split off after Samegoro went mad. I'd rather not have something like that happen again.
Nagisa: So you'll be gone once this is all over…
Ryuuji: Yup. No two ways about it.
Nagisa: … Kenji, there's something I need to tell you.
Ryuuji: Yeah?
Nagisa: I… I've always loved you.
Ryuuji: Nagisa–
Nagisa: D-Don’t say anything! I don't want to know. If you're leaving, then there's no point. I just wanted to get it off my chest. So… So just don't mind it.
(Nagisa leaves the scene)
Ryuuji: *sigh* I've always known, Nagisa. I’ve always known.
