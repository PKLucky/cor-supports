Viola: Of course I do! It's when...uh...um...hmm...could you explain what it is?
Chell: No.
Viola: Oh mannnn
Chell: Where did that come from
Viola: Well Felicity says that when a woman likes a man she needs to stake her claim or some other woman will take him instead and the best way to do that is to seduce him and make him have sex with you
Chell: Sigh...What else has Felicity been telling you
Viola: Oh lots of things for instance-
CHell: Nevermind, forget I asked just remember some thing are private and personal and while a good think are also not something you talk with just anybody.
Viola: Like sex?
