Taylor: Hey! You're Lady Tsubaki's retainer. Nagisa, right?
Nagisa: And you are?
Taylor: Taylor, co-captain of the Medean royal army. Glad to meet ya!
Nagisa: Hmph.
Taylor: Yeesh, Her Highness was right. You're a prickly one.
Nagisa: Can you leave me alone? I'm busy training.
Taylor: I can see that! And that brings me to why I'm here. With you being one of the newbies, I think it's a good idea to get to know each other. Since we're working together and all.
Nagisa: How annoying.
Taylor: Aw, don't be like that. It'll be fun! The way I see it, there's two good ways to get to know a person. One: see them fight. Two: see 'em at the tavern. And I've seen you fight plenty already.
Nagisa: So, we're done here.
Taylor: Oh, no, no, no. I gotta see both sides of the coin! Two different situations, two different sides. Get it?
Nagisa: I'm not going to the tavern with you.
Taylor: Trust me. This'll be the perfect bonding experience. Besides, you're just about done training, aren't you? You'll want a refreshing drink after working so hard.
Nagisa: ... I suppose I'm not against it.
Taylor: There we go! We can get going as soon as you're ready.
(Scene transitions to the tavern.)
Nagisa: An' I just don' *hic!* understand, Taylor! Why'd they jus' *hic!* up an' leave like that, huhhhh?
Taylor: That's... a real rough story, Nagisa.
Taylor, thinking: Yeesh, how drunk is she? She barely had a sip and she's already like this.
Nagisa: An' now I gotta take care of Tsu-Tsu all by m'self...
Taylor: "Tsu-Tsu"? You mean Lady Tsubaki?
Nagisa: Yeah! *hic* Who else would it be?
Taylor: Yeah, that sounds like a lot... Speaking of a lot, you definitely had more than your fill of drinks. Let's head back.
Nagisa: Carry me.
Taylor: Wha--Actually, that's probably not a bad idea. Alright, up and at 'em. Time to go, Nagisa.

Taylor: Yo! Nagisa! Hard at work again, huh?
Nagisa: Oh. Taylor. Hello.
Taylor: Uh, you okay?
Nagisa: Far from it. I was thinking about our time at the tavern. I remember some of what happened, but could you fill in some blanks?
Taylor: I can try.
Nagisa: First off, did I mention anything about Lady Nagisa?
Taylor: You did call her "Tsu-Tsu".
Nagisa: Not. A word. About that. To. ANYONE. Understand?
Taylor: My lips are sealed.
Nagisa: Anything else?
Taylor: You also had me carry you--
Nagisa: WHAT?
Taylor: Hey, you're the one who asked for it! Don't worry, I was all gentlemanly about it.
Nagisa: Oh dear Merin...
Taylor: You also said stuff about Kai and... Kenji, I think? I dunno. Honestly, you were slurring your words a lot, so it was hard to understand most of it.
Nagisa: Forget everything I said about those two.
Taylor: Now, hold on there. I did get some of what you said. It sounded like you really missed having those two around back in Edoyama, right?
Nagisa: ...
Taylor: At least Kai's here! Maybe you can talk things out--
Nagisa: As if I'd talk to a womanizing traitor like him!
(Nagisa leaves the scene.)
Taylor: Huh. Wonder what she meant by that.

Taylor: I still don't get what her problem is. You're an upstanding guy, Kai.
Kai: Pff-- "Upstanding." Sure. Alright. Whatever you say, Taylor.
Taylor: I mean, you left Merinas, but so what? We saw how Emperor Samegoro was acting. Of course you'd leave! And the whole "womanizer" angle? I don't think I've seen you even make eyes at a woman since you got here.
Kai: Then you haven't been paying attention.
Taylor: Huh?
Kai: Don't worry about it. Still, youâ€™re half-right, at least.
(Camera pans to Nagisa who is eavesdropping in the distance)
Nagisa: ...
(Time passes?)
Taylor: Oh, hey, Nagisa! What're you up to?
Nagisa: Nothing. I was just passing through. But...
Taylor: Hm?
Nagisa:
