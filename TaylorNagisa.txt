speak;Taylor;I can see that! And that brings me to why I'm here.|{c:e;Taylor;NoSmile}With you being one of the newbies, I think it's a good idea to get to know each other.|Since we're working together and all.
expression;Nagisa;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Nagisa;How annoying.
expression;Taylor;Smile
speak;Taylor;Aw, don't be like that. It'll be fun!|{c:e;Taylor;Smile,CloseEyes}The way I see it, there's two good ways to get to know a person.|{c:e;Taylor;Smile,NormalBlink}One: see them fight. Two: see 'em at the tavern.|And I've seen you fight plenty already.
expression;Nagisa;NormalBlink
speak;Nagisa;So, we're done here.
expression;Taylor;NoSmile
speak;Taylor;Oh, no, no, no. I gotta see both sides of the coin!|{c:e;Taylor;Smile}Two different situations, two different sides. Get it?
expression;Nagisa;HalfCloseEyes

speak;Nagisa;Oh. Taylor. Hello.
expression;Taylor;NoSmile
speak;Taylor;Uh, you okay?
expression;Nagisa;CloseEyes
speak;Nagisa;Far from it.|{c:e;Nagisa;NormalBlink}I was thinking about our time at the tavern.|I remember some of what happened, but could you fill in some blanks?
speak;Taylor;I can try.
speak;Nagisa;First off, did I mention anything about Lady Nagisa?
speak;Taylor;You did call her "Tsu-Tsu".
bop_portrait;Nagisa
speak;Nagisa;Not. A word. About that. To. ANYONE. Understand?
speak;Taylor;My lips are sealed.
speak;Nagisa;Anything else?
speak;Taylor;You also had me carry you--

A Support
Taylor: I still don't get what her problem is. You’re an upstanding guy, Kai.
Kai: Pff– “Upstanding.” Sure. Alright. Whatever you say, Taylor.
Taylor: I mean, you left Merinas, but so what? We saw how Emperor Samegoro was acting. Of course you'd leave! And the whole “womanizer” angle? I don't think I've seen you even make eyes at a woman since you got here.
Kai: Then you haven't been paying attention.
Taylor: Huh?
Kai: Don't worry about it. Still, you’re half-right, at least.

Nagisa: …
(Time passes?)
Taylor: Oh, hey, Nagisa! What’re you up to?
Nagisa: Nothing. I was just passing through. But…
Taylor: Hm?
Nagisa:
