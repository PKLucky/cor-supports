Chell: Sam, do you have a moment?
Sam: Sure do. What's up?
Chell: You've been in Oregot this whole time?
Sam: Pretty much.
Chell: How did you happen to get the cabin you have?
Sam: Shortly after I left, I was recruited by a mercenary company. They helped me. Gave me training. We cleared out that cabin when it was being used as a bandit hangout. Eventually, I left them and went solo. I went back to that old cabin, cleaned it up a bit, and just used it as a base of operations, so to speak.
Chell: Oh. It's rather large for someone all alone.
Sam: Yeah, a little. But there's still too many bandits. Once Oregot is safer, I'll probably settle down with someone, but not yet.
Chell: You mean you don't have a girlfriend? Perhaps a pretty girl mercenary?
Sam: No, been too busy killing bandits, tracking down the one who killed your parents, and all that.
Chell: You... killed that brigand?
Sam: Still tracking him down. He hasn't left Oregot, I know that much. I got some of his captains, but not him yet. By the way, how's Lin doing? She'd be part of the Pegasus Knight unit by now, right?
Chell: She left, Sam. She went on her own two years ago.
[IF Lin hasn't been recruited]
Chell: I haven't heard from her since the goodbye note she left.
[ELSE]
Chell: She said she was going to be a mercenary.
[END]
Chell: I only hope she's still alive and well.
Sam: I... I see. But anyway, I'm going to go train want to come?
Chell: I would love to. It's been too long.

Chell: You know, Sam, I'm surprised you haven't found someone special by now. No grateful damsels in distress throwing themselves into your arms?
Sam: Haha, no. I have saved plenty of damsels before, though. Various other travelers too. Still, no one's caught my eye. Besides...
Chell: Yes?
Sam: The life I'm living out in the mountains is no life for a girl. Especially a girl that means something to me.
Chell: You're not wrong, and it's sweet of you to think of things like that.
Sam: Oh, thank you?
Chell: But it's not life for a man either, Sam. Think about it. All alone, no one to talk to, no one to share a meal with...
Sam: Hmm...
Chell: You've done that for how many years now?
Sam: Uhhh... Eight, I think.
Chell: Eight years... That's a long time without someone there to keep the bed warm.
Sam: Yeah...? Chell, what are you getting at?
Chell: My point is that I'm sure the right girl would go anywhere with you including into bandit-infested Oregot. And she would help you clear it of bandits.
Sam: I suppose that's true enough.
Chell: There's no supposing about it! What you are aspiring to do--while noble and brave--is foolish. How long until you finish? How long until you clear Oregot?
Sam: Never thought about it. As long as it takes, I guess.
Chell: And you just expect the girl to wait?
Sam: Well... Never thought about that before either.
Chell: Please do. The right girl will want to go with you, Sam. It's too big of a job to do by yourself.
Sam: Thanks, Chell. I'll think about what you said. You shared some insight I haven't considered.
Chell: You're welcome, Sam.
Sam: I'm just not sure who the right girl might be... I'm gonna get something to eat and think it over. See you.
(Sam leaves.)
Chell: *sigh* Just how dense is that man?

Sam: ... Oh! You thought I was talking about your bo--
Chell: Sam, please!

Sam: You're strong, Chell. Very strong. And your axe skills are nothing to look down at either.
Chell: Seems we have two things in common then.
Sam: What's that mean?
(Chell moves closer.)
Chell: Your chest is a LOT bigger than before. So are your arms.
(Sam backs up a pace.)
Sam: Uhhh... thanks? Anyway, why'd you keep using an axe?
Chell: You left and father had died. I guess it was kind of a way to be connected to you. To practice with a weapon you were so fond of. Besides... father liked the axe a lot, too.
Sam: He sure did. He was fast and smooth with how he wielded it. I remember seeing him deflect arrows with the blade of his axe.
Chell: Yeah. (Smiles) Want to go train?
Sam: Sure!
Chell: Just give me a moment to put on my training clothes. It's hot today, so I'm going to wear something light. I'm thinking my shorts today.
Sam: You mean the short ones?
Chell: Yup, sure do.
Sam: Exactly how short are they?
Chell: Very. That's not going to be a... distraction, is it, Sam?
Sam: Uhhhh... Define "distraction."
