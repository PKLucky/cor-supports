??? Hi there!
Michael: Huh? Who said that?
Lucy comes rushing in
Lucy: I did. I’m Lucy!
Michael: You’re a girl
Lucy: Yup! Oh you’re a knight right?
Michael: Uh….yeah?
Lucy! Oh then I should call you Sir Michael then!
Michael: I really don’t think that’s necessary
Lucy: But…..I call Forrest, Sir Forrest. Taylor, Sir Taylor and they’re both knights
Michael: Yes but that’s different.
Lucy: How come?
Michael: It just is
Lucy: Oh why’d you become a knight Sir Michael
Michae smiles: Ha-ha. Please just call me Michael. Sir Michael is embarrassing I haven’t done anything deserving of being called Sir
Lucy: But you’re a knight! And you’re so strong! You protect people!
Michael: Oh there’s plenty of people a lot stronger than I am
Lucy: Like who? Besides Sir Forrest, Sir Taylor, Lady Alex, Princess Kirsta, Lady Chell……..ok maybe that is a lot of people
Michael: Ha-hal It’s ok, it just means I have a long way to go but until then I’m going to do my best
Lucy: Yeah! Me too, well maybe not at protecting people like you do but I’m going to become the best healer ever!
Michael: I’ll do my best to keep you safe so you can become the best healer Lucy
Lucy: And I’ll patch you up if you get hurt!

Lucy: Greetings Sir Michael how dost thou fare on this fine morning?
Michael: Please Lucy...that made my sides hurt it's too funny when you talk in such an antiquated fashion
Lucy: Hee-hee. Yeah it is pretty funny, but seriously how are you doing?
Michael: I'm doing well I like protecting people and keeping them safe just like the knights in the stories I didn't find what I wanted with the Holy Knights but with the knights of Medea while still different from the stories it's still more like what I imagined
Lucy: That's great Michael! I like making people feel better making sure they're no longer sick making their boo-boos go away
Michael: Their boo-boos?
Lucy: Their ouchies!
Michael: Ouchies?
Lucy: Don't make fun of me Sir Michael, ALWAYS be nice to your healer or the healer may refuse to heal you.
Michael: Ok Lucy I'll be nice
Lucy: Good! Bessie approves too, I wish I could heal mom though
Michael: You've never mentioned your mom before
Lucy: She's the best healer in the whole world but she's sick now so I'm filling in I hope she gets better
Michael: I'm sorry to hear that I hope she gets better
Lucy: Me too. How about you do you have a mom?
[NEEDS REVISION]
	Michael: Yes she's in Foliaga I'm a little worried about her what with all the commotion from us trying to smooth things over in Foliaga but she's in no danger
	Lucy: Maybe you should write a letter to her?
	Michael: I did. I make sure to write to her whenever I can and let her know how I'm doing and assure her things are well, she tells me in her letters she's safe.
	Lucy: That's good she sounds nice.
	Michael: She's the best
	Lucy: No mine's the best
	Michael: No mi-
	Lucy: Huh-uh. Mine's better
	Michael: How long is this going to keep up?
	Lucy: No idea! Let's make sure we both stay safe so we can see our mommas when this all over
	Michael: That's a good idea Lucy
