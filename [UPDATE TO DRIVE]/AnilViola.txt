[Viola asks Anil for help with (insert chore for the army here). Anil begins to write down his responses on paper, but Viola more or less understands what he's trying to convey despite him being unable to speak. Anil asks her about this, but Viola doesn't really know HOW she can intuit what he's saying, she can just tell. Despite this, Anil offers to teach her some basic sign language just so she doesn't have to just rely on her gut to understand what he's saying. Viola agrees to this.]

Viola: Alright, that should be enough for today. Great job out there, Mello! Good girl!
Mello: Neigh!
(Anil enters the scene.)
Viola: Oh, hi, Anil! Are you gonna do some training too? I'd love to join you, but I don't wanna tire out Mello.
Anil: [Mello?]
Viola: Yeah, you know, my Pegasus! I guess I never properly introduced you two. Anil, this is Mello. Mello, this is Anil.
Mello: Neigh!! *snort*
Viola: Huh? What's wrong, girl?
Mello: *whinny!* Neigh!
Viola: Oh, calm down! You see Anil out on the battlefield with us all the time.
Mellow: Neigh!! Neigh!!!
Viola: He only shoots down the bad guys. You know that!
Mello: *snort*
Anil: [You understand what she's saying?]
Viola: Uh-huh! Mello and I have been partners for a long time, so it comes with the territory.
Anil: [Hm... Maybe. It seems similar to how you could understand what I was saying back when we started talking, though.]
Viola: You know what, you have a point. That's really interesting now that you mention it.
Anil: [Any theories for why you can understand both me and Mello?]
Viola: Hm... Not really. But it's really cool that I can! I'll have to some thinking about it. Anyway, I'm gonna take Mello back to the stables and grab a bite to eat. See ya later!

[Viola meets up with Anil and reports back on her self-reflection. She comes to the conclusion that animals tend to be honest with their intentions and she sees Anil as a pretty honest person himself.]
