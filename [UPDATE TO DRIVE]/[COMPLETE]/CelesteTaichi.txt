Celeste: That last battle was really intense, but it was nothing I couldn't handle! Hup! Hiya! Shah!
Taichi: It's so dark... Whatever, not much different than what I'm used to. Just more trees.
(Celeste throws the axe to a tree.)
Celeste: Hyah!
Taichi: Woah! Be careful where you swing that!
Celeste: Sorry! Wasn't trying to hit you.
Taichi: Why are you swinging your axe like crazy in the dark?
Celeste: I gotta be prepared for anything. A bad guy could come and attack during the night. It also allows my eyes to see better in the dark. Not just at night, but caves too!
Taichi: Sorry to say, but it seems to not be working that well since you nearly hit me.
Celeste: Well, I wasn't expecting to see you! But besides that, it just means I need more practice!
Taichi: Shh! Lower your voice. Everyone all the way back at camp can probably hear you with how loud you're yelling.
Celeste: Ah! You're right! Whoops, I yelled again! Wait--
(Taichi puts a hand over Celeste's mouth.)
Celeste: Mm!
Taichi: And I'm stopping you there. Man, what are you, twelve?
Celeste: Hey, I'm wayyy more mature than that. I'm seventeen!
Taichi: With how you're acting, you might as well be that young. Heck, I bet when you were actually twelve, your mom caught you sneaking out at night because of how loud you got.
Celeste: *gasp!* How'd you know?
Taichi: Honestly, I was joking with that. You're just like my brother Haruki. He'd do stuff like that all the time. Actually, he still does. Heh, I guess fourteen isn't all that different from twelve.
Celeste: Hey, what's that supposed to mean?! That's it! One week from today at high noon, we duel! We'll see who's the immature one here.
Taichi: Wait, what--
Celeste: Prepare yourself!
(Celeste leaves)
Taichi: Well, it seems like I'm watching two kids now.

Celeste: So, you're here.
Taichi: We arrived at the same time.
Celeste: Have anything to say before we throw axes?
Taichi: I think we should probably delay this because we forgot to get wood for the army.
Celeste: Wait. Oh, darn! How could I have forgotten!
Taichi: Have you been focused on this battle all week?
Celeste: Well, I... Yes. I was super hyped for this and it miiiight have taken up a lot of my week?
Taichi: That's not good. We should probably get wood now.
Celeste: On it!
(They go to the forest.)
Celeste: So, how much have you been prepping for our duel?
Taichi: Not much, really. I was taking care of stuff around camp. If anything, I was coming up with strategies.
Celeste: That's it? What about practicing with your axe?
Taichi: Didn't do much more practice than usual.
Celeste: Hmm... Alright, we can push the duel to a later time.
Taichi: Why? Weren't you looking forward to it?
Celeste: It doesn't seem fair. Plus, we don't have enough time to warm up. We still have more trees to chop down. And after that, we have to carry the wood back to base.
Taichi: Yeah, true.
Celeste: You're not a bad guy, Taichi. When in a friendly battle, we gotta play fair.
Taichi: You got that right. Alright, I think that's enough wood. Let's get back to base. I'll be sure to practice up for that duel.
Celeste: You better!

Celeste: *Huff huff* Who won?
Taichi: *Huff* I don't know. *Huff* Let's just call it a draw for now.
Celeste: No way...! *Huff* We gotta decide a winner!
Taichi: We can do another round later. I'm exhausted. Aren't you?
Celeste: Hmm... Okay, fine.
Taichi: So, where did you learn how to use an axe?
Celeste: My mom taught me. She is-- Was-- Is! One of the Holy Knights of Foliaga. She's pretty cool and taught me a lot of other things too.
Taichi: What happened to your mom?
Celeste: I-I don't know. I haven't seen her since I fled from Florene Village. Did your mother also teach you how to use axes?
Taichi: Yeah. When I was five, both my parents started training me in axes. My mom was a famous warrior back in the day. She didn't just use axes, but swords too.
Celeste: Woah, that's cool! We both have cool moms!
Taichi: My dad was no slouch either. Like I said, he taught me axes too. He was a gladiator with a long win streak under his belt. He met my mom at the arena where they dueled each other. The match ended in a draw, and they got married some time after that.
Celeste: Wow. I don't even know who my dad is. My mom said he left before I was born and that he had green hair and green eyes. ... Hey, wait, you kept saying "was." Is your dad...?
Taichi: Yeah. A few years after Haruki was born, my dad started fighting in the arena again to bring more money back home. Things were great. My mom was still teaching me axes and my dad told me and Haruki all about his victories in the arena. Then... ...
Celeste: Taichi...
Taichi: I remember that day when one of the militia men knocked on our door. Mom didn't want me in the room when they were talking, but I heard everything. Some sore loser from the arena killed my dad. He was supposed to be home for my birthday the next day...
Celeste: ...
Taichi: After that, my mom retired and started becoming more protective of us. I knew then I had to step up and take care of Haruki too. But that meant that I had to train myself more and more.
Celeste: ...
Taichi: *sigh* Sorry, that was all a real downer, huh?
Celeste: Don't worry about it. It's nice that you at least have some good memories of your dad.
Taichi: Yeah... How about your dad? Do you ever wonder about him?
Celeste: Sometimes. Maybe more now because I'm worried about my mom. I never knew him, but if he left Mom, then I don't think he's a good person.
Taichi: Celeste...
Celeste: Aw, don't give me that look. I'll be fine. Like I said, I never the knew the guy. If I ever met him, I wouldn't care. He'd be just some stranger.
Taichi: I guess you have a point.
Celeste: But hey, your parents are pretty cool. Got any more stories about them?
Taichi: Well, there was that time when I was two and tried lifting my mom's axe. My dad was laughing so hard and...

Celeste: You!
(Celeste throws her axe at a target)
Celeste: Take that!
Taichi: Nice shot. Better than the previous one.
Celeste: This time I had a target.
Taichi: Yeah, one that you could actually see.
Celeste: Hmph! I hit it on the mark! That's the important thing.
Taichi: How many hits can you get?
Celeste: More than you. 
Taichi: Then let's test it. Five throws for each of us.
Celeste: You're on!
(Ten axe throws later...)
Celeste: Told ya I'd get more than you!
Taichi: You got ONE more than me. We're closer than you think.
Celeste: Then we'll make a great team against the forces of evil!
Taichi: How about another duel? If I win, we go on a date. If you win--
Celeste: Then you join me in the great mission to fight crime and the forces of evil!
Taichi: Same place?
Celeste: It would be only fair, wouldn't it? Race ya there!
Taichi: If we race there, we'll be too tired for the actual duel.
Celeste: Sorry, was pulling your leg.
Taichi: Sure you were.
