speak;Forrest;So, Trevor, how have you been lately?|Not too stressed from your first time on the battlefield, I hope.
expression;Trevor;Smile
speak;Trevor;Why, I have been doing quite well, thank you.|Fighting alongside you, Her Highness, and everyone else has been most exhilarating.
speak;Forrest;That's a relief to hear.|Most people can't handle being in the heat of battle.|I know when I was still a squire,|just the thought of hurting someone else made me uneasy.
expression;Trevor;NoSmile
speak;Trevor;Is that so? That is difficult to believe, in my opinion.|{c:e;Trevor;Smile}Why, look at you now!|You have been protecting Her Highness from ruffians left and right like|a true knight should.
expression;Forrest;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Forrest;Most of those rescue missions were unnecessary, but yes.|{c:e;Forrest;NormalBlink}I have gotten used to upholding my duties as Princess Krista's knight.
expression;Trevor;NoSmile
speak;Trevor;Just how do you do it, Forrest?|I am sure this change of heart did not happen overnight.
speak;Forrest;No, it didn't. It felt like it did, though.|I had to do a lot of self-reflection after Princess Krista|was first kidnapped by bandits eight years ago.
speak;Trevor;Eight years ago?
speak;Forrest;Yes. This was back when Sam was still with us.|And unlike the many times after this one,|this kidnapping was not deliberate on Krista's part.
speak;Trevor;That must have been a traumatic experience. At least one would assume so.|And if that were the case, why would Her Highness keep letting herself--
expression;Forrest;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Forrest;Don't ask questions you're not prepared to hear the answer to, Trevor.
speak;Trevor;Understood.{c:e;Trevor;HalfCloseEyes}{tgm}...{tgm} I think.|{c:e;Trevor;NormalBlink}Regardless, please continue, Forrest.
expression;Forrest;NormalBlink
speak;Forrest;We were young when it happened. I would have been around your age, in fact.|The princess was not in any danger before that point,|so it never occurred to me that I would have to raise my sword to serve her.|Not until that day.
speak;Trevor;Forrest{tgm}...
speak;Forrest;Trevor, while I am glad you can hold your own,|do not forget your duties as Princess Krista's retainer.|You have to be there to protect her no matter what.|That is your number one priority.
expression;Trevor;CloseEyes
speak;Trevor;No matter what{tgm}...

speak;Forrest;Trevor, just what were you doing out there during the last battle?!|If I weren't close by, Her Highness would have--
speak;Trevor;Do you think I don't know that?!|By Medea, Forrest, when there's that many enemies surrounding us,|there's only so much I can do.|Some of us aren't as brawny as you are.
speak;Forrest;That is no excuse. Remember what I said before?|Protecting Princess Krista is your top priority.
speak;Trevor;Are you suggesting my own life is not as important as hers?
speak;Forrest;Is that even a question?
speak;Trevor;Do you even comprehend your own words right now, Forrest?|It is one thing to serve Her Highness, but to throw one's own life away so carelessly?|That is inconceivable!
speak;Forrest;Then, I'm afraid you will have to reconsider your position as her retainer, Trevor.|It's a difficult concept to grasp, I know. But it is necessary.|Princess Krista is Medeas' future queen. Without her, the kingdom will fall.
speak;Trevor;But even so, what if we were gone?|Who would be there to protect her?
expression;Forrest;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Forrest;There are other knights and mages, Trevor.|We can be replaced if need be.
speak;Trevor;You do not honestly believe that, do you?
expression;Forrest;NormalBlink
speak;Forrest;It does not matter what my personal feelings are. This is just the reality of the situation.|{c:e;Forrest;CloseEyes}I{tgm}...{tgm} have come to accept that a long time ago.
expression;Trevor;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Trevor;{tgm}...{tgm} Are you sure about that?
expression;Forrest;NormalBlink
speak;Forrest;Look. We are done here, Trevor.|Just think about what I said.|Do not let Her Highness be in peril again.

speak;Trevor;Forrest, are you well? You seemed distracted during the last battle.
speak;Forrest;That is just your imagination, Trevor. I'm perfectly fine.
speak;Trevor;I am not so sure about that.|You were so focused on your own actions, you paid no attention to anything else around you.
expression;Forrest;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Forrest;Is that so{tgm}...?
expression;Trevor;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Trevor;Seeing you waver like this is unusual, and quite frankly, it worries me.|{c:e;Trevor;NormalBlink}I wish to help you if something is troubling you, Forrest.|You are my friend, after all.
expression;Forrest;CloseEyes
speak;Forrest;{tgm}...{tgm}|{c:e;Forrest;NormalBlink}I was thinking about our discussion from some time ago.|I know I said we could be replaced, but{tgm}...{tgm}|I wish to remain at Her Highness' side for as long as I can.|{c:e;Forrest;CloseEyes}The fear of losing her overwhelmed me, I suppose.
expression;Trevor;CloseEyes,Smile
speak;Trevor;So, there IS a human heart beneath all that armor.
expression;Forrest;CloseEyes,Smile
speak;Forrest;Oh, please.|{c:e;Forrest;NormalBlink,NoSmile}This may sound selfish of me,|but I do not wish to entrust her life to someone else's hands.|To tell you the truth, when Her Highness brought in Felicity, then Kai, then you{tgm}...{tgm}|I had my doubts about you all. But you proved your worth eventually.
expression;Trevor;NormalBlink,NoSmile
speak;Trevor;I am not sure if I should be elated or offended.
expression;Forrest;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Forrest;I apologize. I'm not very good at this.
expression;Trevor;Smile
speak;Trevor;Do not fret. I know you meant well.|I admire your honesty even if you can be blunt about it at times.
expression;Forrest;CloseEyes
speak;Forrest;My honesty, hm{tgm}...?{tgm}|{c:e;Forrest;NormalBlink}May I confess something to you?|I actually haven't said the whole truth.
expression;Trevor;NoSmile
speak;Trevor;Oh?
speak;Forrest;I may be upholding my duties as Princess Krista's knight, but ultimately, I{tgm}...{tgm}|{c:e;Forrest;CloseEyes}I love her, Trevor.
speak;Trevor;I{tgm}...{tgm} see{tgm}...
expression;Forrest;NormalBlink
speak;Forrest;That's why I can't let her go to anyone else.
speak;Trevor;I can understand the sentiment, Forrest.|{c:e;Trevor;CloseEyes}I also{tgm}...
speak;Forrest;Hm?
expression;Trevor;NormalBlink
speak;Trevor;Ah, nothing. Pay me no mind.|{c:e;Trevor;Smile}At any rate, let us continue to do good work together.
expression;Forrest;Smile
speak;Forrest;Of course.
