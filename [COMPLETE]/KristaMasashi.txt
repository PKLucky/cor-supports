expression;Masashi;NoSmile
speak;Masashi;I would like to humbly apologize for my behavior when we first met.|It was, quite frankly, a terrible first impression.
expression;Krista;CloseEyes
speak;Krista;You can say that again.
speak;Masashi;I see now the error of my ways.|{c:e;Masashi;Smile}Why, your beauty is unparalleled!|You swing your blade with such grace.|The way you lead your army has such refinement.|I was completely wrong about you!

expression;Krista;CloseEyes
speak;Krista;Sure, sure.|{c:e;Krista;NormalBlink}Anyway, I've got more important things to do than listen to shallow compliments.|See ya.

speak;Masashi;Your Highness? Is something wrong?

speak;Krista;Yes. Multiple somethings, actually.|{c:e;Krista;NormalBlink}It's about all the gifts from you that were outside my chambers.
speak;Masashi;Oh, is that all? Did you not like them?
speak;Krista;Look, I will admit this is very flattering.|{c:e;Krista;CloseEyes}But, dear Medea,|I can just feel Forrest staring daggers at you from across the room.|{c:e;Krista;NormalBlink}I'm saying this because I'm honestly fearing for your life--

speak;Masashi;You actually care about me?
