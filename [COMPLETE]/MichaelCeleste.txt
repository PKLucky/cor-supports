Celeste: Heyyy, Michael! Wanna go shopping together? There's a bunch of cool shops nearby.
Michael: I don't know... Last time we went shopping was at that fireworks store. And I don't want us to clean up another huge mess.
Celeste: Don't worry! It's not gonna be like that this time. I wanna hit up a gem store. There's these gem pairs that mean "Best Friends Forever". I want to take you with me and see if we can get them.
Michael: O-Oh, well, thank you. I guess I'll go, then. But, uh, it's not going to be really crowded there, is it?
Celeste: I don't think so. It's at an open-air market, so things should be spread out. Are you worried about seeing a lot of people? We can go to the smaller stores first if you aren't comfortable.
Michael: N-No, that's not it. I just don't--
Celeste: Then, let's go!
(Celeste leaves the scene.)
Michael: --want to cause another mess. Ah, Celeste, wait!
(Michael chases after her.)

Celeste: Michael, I have a question.
Michael: What's the matter?
Celeste: Is your armor too heavy for you? You've never been particularly strong, and I'd be upset if something were to happen to you.
Michael: The armor is okay. I'm... not having any trouble with it.
Celeste: Really?
(Celeste picks Michael up.)
Celeste: Hup!
Michael: Wh-Whoa!
Celeste: I'm taller than you, older than you, and still physically stronger than you.
Michael: P-Please put me down. The armor is fine.
Celeste: Is that so? I'll have to carry you with it on to see if it is. If I can, then that means you'll be fine.
Michael: The armor's light!
Celeste: Alright, I get it. Let me put you down.
(Celeste sets Michael back down.)
Celeste: But if it really is, could I wear it?
Michael: W-Well, um--I-I'll be back!
(Michael leaves the scene.)
Celeste: I hope he's really fine in all that armor. I wouldn't want him to strain himself.

Celeste: *sigh* What am I going to do? I need to find my mother when this is all over, but how will I know if she'll be okay?
(Michael enters the scene.)
Michael: Celeste?
Celeste: Oh, Michael. Uh... The beach is pretty nice, isn't it? Check out this pearl I found!
Michael: There's something wrong, isn't there? Please don't hide it.
Celeste: How long were you here?
Michael: I came here a while ago to get resources. I heard you talking to yourself about your mother. It's weird seeing you so upset.
Celeste: You don't have to worry about me. I'm fine. Speaking of her, remember she said you'd be good at using lances? Turns out she was right.
Michael: Huh, yeah. My mother, on the other hand, was against it. She was always teaching me that I must be polite whenever I can. Needless to say, she thought using weapons wasn't "polite". Still, that didn't stop her from letting us go to each other's houses. Even if you were a little... energetic.
Celeste: Huh, really? I remember you were often there for my axe training. I even let you try giving it a couple of swings.
Michael: Mm-hm. It was fun. With that, I guess what I'm trying to say is that if there is anything bothering you, you can tell me. We're friends, after all.
Celeste: ... Hey, Michael, why don't we do some stone skipping?
Michael: H-Huh?
Celeste: Here, take one!
(Celeste hands Michael a stone.)
Michael: B-But--
Celeste: No use in dwelling on something we can't control. So, come on! Let's have some fun!
Michael: Er, alright.

Michael: This forest looks familiar...
(Michael sees Celeste in the distance.)
Michael: Celeste?
Celeste: Oh, hey, Michael. Looking for more resources again?
Michael: Yeah. What are you doing out here?
Celeste: I was just looking for my axe. How do I lose something like that?
Michael: It's not the craziest thing you lost. Remember when I had to help you find your mom's shield that one winter?
Celeste: Haha, yeah. That took us the whole day. Never used THAT as a sled again.
Michael: Ha! I hope not. Anyway, let's see if we can find your axe.
Celeste: Yeah!
(Some time later...)
Michael: Hey, does this place look familiar to you?
Celeste: You too? Like the time we first met when I saved you from bullies?
Michael: Mm-hm. They told me to go in, otherwise they'd said they do something to my mom.
Celeste: It was a good thing I showed up when I did, then. I came in, beat them senseless, and they ran away. You were crying, so we just started talking to calm you down. I remember telling you about how the forest wasn't that scary, and a bunch of other stuff. And then we both said that our favorite color--
Celeste and Michael: Was green!
Michael: If you didn't do that, I'd be just an errand boy for them, and I wouldn't have thought of joining the knights. I've got to thank you for that.
Celeste: You already have. After that, I took you back to my house. My mom wasn't sure how she felt about me going to the forest by myself. But she was glad I rescued someone.
Michael: Well, can't really say I'd blame her. We were pretty dirty. You also begged her to let me stay the next two days.
Celeste: Ah... I wish I could find her soon.
Michael: Hey, when this is all over, we'll go find your mom and ask her if... if we could start dating.
Celeste: Michael...
Michael: Then you can actually reading the books I gave you.
Celeste: What do you mean?! I do read them.
Michael: You skim through them.
Celeste: I do not! I-- Oh! My axe! Hey, how about I help you gather resources now?
Michael: That'd be great. Thanks, Celeste.
