Krista: Hey, Chell! I wasn't expecting to meet my favorite Pegasus knight here.
Chell: Heh. You say that to every knight in your service, but thank you. I like to relax in the sauna after a good training session. 
Krista: Same here. Your shoulders look great! I didn't realize how good they were.
Chell: Please, Your Highness. On that note, your back is looking good. How is your swordsmanship with Kai going?
Krista: Going good! He's very quick with a blade. Speaking of which, how's your axe training going?
Chell: It's going well. It must be where the shoulder muscles are coming from. Anyway, if you ever want to train together, I'm at your service. I'm sure we could learn a lot from each other. 
Krista: Sure! I'd like that. Besides, I can see your thunder thighs in action.
Chell: Your thighs are pretty good as well, Your Highness. I'll see you next time.

Krista: Off to the sauna again, Chell?
Chell: Why, yes. Would you like to join me?
Krista: Yeah, I'd love to!
(Scene transitions to the sauna.)
Krista: Man, I didn't think it'd be possible, but I think you got even buffer since the last time we were in the sauna together.
Chell: Hm? I might be. I have been incorporating more meat into my diet. And with all the extra training and practice spars, it's not too surprising. On that note, you've been getting more muscle definition as well. Your back muscles especially.
Krista: Really? I can't get a good look at them myself, so I'll take your word for it.
Chell: Speaking of training, still going well, I take it?
Krista: No complaints here!
Chell: That's good. You know, despite you switching teachers multiple times, I can still see my father's influence on your technique.
Krista: Oh?
Chell: Your defensive maneuvers are similar to Forrest's. And you've gotten more swift with the blade after Kai started to teach you. However, the power you put into your swings was something my father advised to you, wasn't it?
Krista: Sure was. Ol' man Gibson always did say the best defense is a good offense.
Chell: Yes, that sounds like something Father would say.
Krista: ...
Chell: Your Highness?
Krista: Gibson was a good man. I still miss him, but it must be a lot tougher for you.
Chell: That is true. I miss him dearly. But I cannot let that weigh down on me. I won't allow it to.

Chell: Father, why? Why did you have to die like that? You were so strong. Sam tried to avenge you and he got some of them, but... I will get stronger, Father. I will stamp them into dust. Hya! Hrah! Hoo-ah! I will kill them all!!
(Krista enters the scene.)
Krista: Chell? Was that you just now?
Chell: What? Oh, it's you, Your Highness. Pardon me. Let me get my shirt on.
Krista: There's no need. It's just us, and none of the men are around. What are you doing training so late? And all that yelling earlier... I caught some of it, but...
Chell: I had a nightmare about that day and I couldn't go back to sleep. Sometimes when I'm too angry or restless, I come here and train. Really train. Holding nothing back. But I get really sweaty and build up quite the heat, so I only do training like this at night.Krista

Krista: Hey, Chell! I wasn't expecting to meet my favorite Pegasus knight here.
Chell: Heh. You say that to every knight in your service, but thank you. I like to relax in the sauna after a good training session. 
Krista: Same here. Your shoulders look great! I didn't realize how good they were.
Chell: Please, Your Highness. On that note, your back is looking good. How is your swordsmanship with Kai going?
Krista: Going good! He's very quick with a blade. Speaking of which, how's your axe training going?
Chell: It's going well. It must be where the shoulder muscles are coming from. Anyway, if you ever want to train together, I'm at your service. I'm sure we could learn a lot from each other. 
Krista: Sure! I'd like that. Besides, I can see your thunder thighs in action.
Chell: Your thighs are pretty good as well, Your Highness. I'll see you next time.

Krista: Off to the sauna again, Chell?
Chell: Why, yes. Would you like to join me?
Krista: Yeah, I'd love to!
(Scene transitions to the sauna.)
Krista: Man, I didn't think it'd be possible, but I think you got even buffer since the last time we were in the sauna together.
Chell: Hm? I might be. I have been incorporating more meat into my diet. And with all the extra training and practice spars, it's not too surprising. On that note, you've been getting more muscle definition as well. Your back muscles especially.
Krista: Really? I can't get a good look at them myself, so I'll take your word for it.
Chell: Speaking of training, still going well, I take it?
Krista: No complaints here!
Chell: That's good. You know, despite you switching teachers multiple times, I can still see my father's influence on your technique.
Krista: Oh?
Chell: Your defensive maneuvers are similar to Forrest's. And you've gotten more swift with the blade after Kai started to teach you. However, the power you put into your swings was something my father advised to you, wasn't it?
Krista: Sure was. Ol' man Gibson always did say the best defense is a good offense.
Chell: Yes, that sounds like something Father would say.
Krista: ...
Chell: Your Highness?
Krista: Gibson was a good man. I still miss him, but it must be a lot tougher for you.
Chell: That is true. I miss him dearly. But I cannot let that weigh down on me. I won't allow it to.

Chell: Father, why? Why did you have to die like that? You were so strong. Sam tried to avenge you and he got some of them, but... I will get stronger, Father. I will stamp them into dust. Hya! Hrah! Hoo-ah! I will kill them all!!
(Krista enters the scene.)
Krista: Chell? Was that you just now?
Chell: What? Oh, it's you, Your Highness. Pardon me. Let me get my shirt on.
Krista: There's no need. It's just us, and none of the men are around. What are you doing training so late? And all that yelling earlier... I caught some of it, but...
Chell: I had a nightmare about that day and I couldn't go back to sleep. Sometimes when I'm too angry or restless, I come here and train. Really train. Holding nothing back. But I get really sweaty and build up quite the heat, so I only do training like this at night.Krista

Chell: What? Oh, it's you, Your Highness. Pardon me. Let me get my shirt on.

Chell: I had a nightmare about that day and I couldn't go back to sleep. Sometimes when I'm too angry or restless, I come here and train. Really train. Holding nothing back. But I get really sweaty and build up quite the heat, so I only do training like this at night.Krista

Krista: Hey, Chell! I wasn't expecting to meet my favorite Pegasus knight here.
Chell: Heh. You say that to every knight in your service, but thank you. I like to relax in the sauna after a good training session. 
Krista: Same here. Your shoulders look great! I didn't realize how good they were.
Chell: Please, Your Highness. On that note, your back is looking good. How is your swordsmanship with Kai going?
Krista: Going good! He's very quick with a blade. Speaking of which, how's your axe training going?
Chell: It's going well. It must be where the shoulder muscles are coming from. Anyway, if you ever want to train together, I'm at your service. I'm sure we could learn a lot from each other. 
Krista: Sure! I'd like that. Besides, I can see your thunder thighs in action.
Chell: Your thighs are pretty good as well, Your Highness. I'll see you next time.

Krista: Off to the sauna again, Chell?
Chell: Why, yes. Would you like to join me?
Krista: Yeah, I'd love to!
(Scene transitions to the sauna.)
Krista: Man, I didn't think it'd be possible, but I think you got even buffer since the last time we were in the sauna together.
Chell: Hm? I might be. I have been incorporating more meat into my diet. And with all the extra training and practice spars, it's not too surprising. On that note, you've been getting more muscle definition as well. Your back muscles especially.
Krista: Really? I can't get a good look at them myself, so I'll take your word for it.
Chell: Speaking of training, still going well, I take it?
Krista: No complaints here!
Chell: That's good. You know, despite you switching teachers multiple times, I can still see my father's influence on your technique.
Krista: Oh?
Chell: Your defensive maneuvers are similar to Forrest's. And you've gotten more swift with the blade after Kai started to teach you. However, the power you put into your swings was something my father advised to you, wasn't it?
Krista: Sure was. Ol' man Gibson always did say the best defense is a good offense.
Chell: Yes, that sounds like something Father would say.
Krista: ...
Chell: Your Highness?
Krista: Gibson was a good man. I still miss him, but it must be a lot tougher for you.
Chell: That is true. I miss him dearly. But I cannot let that weigh down on me. I won't allow it to.

Krista: Really? I can't get a good look at them myself, so I'll take your word for it.
Chell: Speaking of training, still going well, I take it?
Krista: No complaints here!
Chell: That's good. You know, despite you switching teachers multiple times, I can still see my father's influence on your technique.
Krista: Oh?
Chell: Your defensive maneuvers are similar to Forrest's. And you've gotten more swift with the blade after Kai started to teach you. However, the power you put into your swings was something my father advised to you, wasn't it?
Krista: Sure was. Ol' man Gibson always did say the best defense is a good offense.
Chell: Yes, that sounds like something Father would say.
Krista: ...
Chell: Your Highness?
Krista: Gibson was a good man. I still miss him, but it must be a lot tougher for you.
Chell: That is true. I miss him dearly. But I cannot let that weigh down on me. I won't allow it to.
Krista: Chell...

Chell: Father, why? Why did you have to die like that? You were so strong. Sam tried to avenge you and he got some of them, but... I will get stronger, Father. I will stamp them into dust. Hya! Hrah! Hoo-ah! I will kill them all!!
(Krista enters the scene.)
Krista: Chell? Was that you just now?
Chell: What? Oh, it's you, Your Highness. Pardon me. Let me get my shirt on.
Krista: There's no need. It's just us, and none of the men are around. What are you doing training so late? And all that yelling earlier... I caught some of it, but...
Chell: I had a nightmare about that day and I couldn't go back to sleep. Sometimes when I'm too angry or restless, I come here and train. Really train. Holding nothing back. But I get really sweaty and build up quite the heat, so I only do training like this at night.Krista

Getting rid of evil-doers is good on paper, but you gotta think about the motivation behind the act, too. {c:e;Krista;HalfCloseEyes}I just don't want to let you lose yourself to your anger, Chell. You might end up doing something you regret.

Chell: Heh. You say that to every knight in your service, but thank you. I like to relax in the sauna after a good training session. 
Krista: Same here. Your shoulders look great! I didn't realize how good they were.
Chell: Please, Your Highness. On that note, your back is looking good. How is your swordsmanship with Kai going?
Krista: Going good! He's very quick with a blade. Speaking of which, how's your axe training going?
Chell: It's going well. It must be where the shoulder muscles are coming from. Anyway, if you ever want to train together, I'm at your service. I'm sure we could learn a lot from each other. 
Krista: Sure! I'd like that. Besides, I can see your thunder thighs in action.

Krista: Hey, Chell! I wasn't expecting to meet my favorite Pegasus knight here.
Chell: Heh. You say that to every knight in your service, but thank you. I like to relax in the sauna after a good training session. 
Krista: Same here. Your shoulders look great! I didn't realize how good they were.
Chell: Please, Your Highness. On that note, your back is looking good. How is your swordsmanship with Kai going?
Krista: Going good! He's very quick with a blade. Speaking of which, how's your axe training going?
Chell: It's going well. It must be where the shoulder muscles are coming from. Anyway, if you ever want to train together, I'm at your service. I'm sure we could learn a lot from each other. 
Krista: Sure! I'd like that. Besides, I can see your thunder thighs in action.
Chell: Your thighs are pretty good as well, Your Highness. I'll see you next time.

Krista: Off to the sauna again, Chell?
Chell: Why, yes. Would you like to join me?
Krista: Yeah, I'd love to!
(Scene transitions to the sauna.)
Krista: Man, I didn't think it'd be possible, but I think you got even buffer since the last time we were in the sauna together.
Chell: Hm? I might be. I have been incorporating more meat into my diet. And with all the extra training and practice spars, it's not too surprising. On that note, you've been getting more muscle definition as well. Your back muscles especially.
Krista: Really? I can't get a good look at them myself, so I'll take your word for it.
Chell: Speaking of training, still going well, I take it?
Krista: No complaints here!
Chell: That's good. You know, despite you switching teachers multiple times, I can still see my father's influence on your technique.
Krista: Oh?
Chell: Your defensive maneuvers are similar to Forrest's. And you've gotten more swift with the blade after Kai started to teach you. However, the power you put into your swings was something my father advised to you, wasn't it?
Krista: Sure was. Ol' man Gibson always did say the best defense is a good offense.
Chell: Yes, that sounds like something Father would say.
Krista: ...
Chell: Your Highness?
Krista: Gibson was a good man. I still miss him, but it must be a lot tougher for you.
Chell: That is true. I miss him dearly. But I cannot let that weigh down on me. I won't allow it to.

Chell: Father, why? Why did you have to die like that? You were so strong. Sam tried to avenge you and he got some of them, but... I will get stronger, Father. I will stamp them into dust. Hya! Hrah! Hoo-ah! I will kill them all!!
(Krista enters the scene.)
Krista: Chell? Was that you just now?
Chell: What? Oh, it's you, Your Highness. Pardon me. Let me get my shirt on.
Krista: There's no need. It's just us, and none of the men are around. What are you doing training so late? And all that yelling earlier... I caught some of it, but...
Chell: I had a nightmare about that day and I couldn't go back to sleep. Sometimes when I'm too angry or restless, I come here and train. Really train. Holding nothing back. But I get really sweaty and build up quite the heat, so I only do training like this at night.Krista

Krista: Hey, Chell! I wasn't expecting to meet my favorite Pegasus knight here.
Chell: Heh. You say that to every knight in your service, but thank you. I like to relax in the sauna after a good training session. 
Krista: Same here. Your shoulders look great! I didn't realize how good they were.
Chell: Please, Your Highness. On that note, your back is looking good. How is your swordsmanship with Kai going?
Krista: Going good! He's very quick with a blade. Speaking of which, how's your axe training going?
Chell: It's going well. It must be where the shoulder muscles are coming from. Anyway, if you ever want to train together, I'm at your service. I'm sure we could learn a lot from each other. 
Krista: Sure! I'd like that. Besides, I can see your thunder thighs in action.
Chell: Your thighs are pretty good as well, Your Highness. I'll see you next time.

Krista: Off to the sauna again, Chell?
Chell: Why, yes. Would you like to join me?
Krista: Yeah, I'd love to!
(Scene transitions to the sauna.)
Krista: Man, I didn't think it'd be possible, but I think you got even buffer since the last time we were in the sauna together.
Chell: Hm? I might be. I have been incorporating more meat into my diet. And with all the extra training and practice spars, it's not too surprising. On that note, you've been getting more muscle definition as well. Your back muscles especially.
Krista: Really? I can't get a good look at them myself, so I'll take your word for it.
Chell: Speaking of training, still going well, I take it?
Krista: No complaints here!
Chell: That's good. You know, despite you switching teachers multiple times, I can still see my father's influence on your technique.
Krista: Oh?
Chell: Your defensive maneuvers are similar to Forrest's. And you've gotten more swift with the blade after Kai started to teach you. However, the power you put into your swings was something my father advised to you, wasn't it?
Krista: Sure was. Ol' man Gibson always did say the best defense is a good offense.
Chell: Yes, that sounds like something Father would say.
Krista: ...
Chell: Your Highness?
Krista: Gibson was a good man. I still miss him, but it must be a lot tougher for you.
Chell: That is true. I miss him dearly. But I cannot let that weigh down on me. I won't allow it to.

(Krista enters the scene.)
Krista: Chell? Was that you just now?
Chell: What? Oh, it's you, Your Highness. Pardon me. Let me get my shirt on.
Krista: There's no need. It's just us, and none of the men are around. What are you doing training so late? And all that yelling earlier... I caught some of it, but...
Chell: I had a nightmare about that day and I couldn't go back to sleep. Sometimes when I'm too angry or restless, I come here and train. Really train. Holding nothing back. But I get really sweaty and build up quite the heat, so I only do training like this at night.Krista

Chell: Your Highness?
Krista: Gibson was a good man. I still miss him, but it must be a lot tougher for you.
Chell: That is true. I miss him dearly. But I cannot let that weigh down on me. I won't allow it to.

Chell: Father, why? Why did you have to die like that? You were so strong. Sam tried to avenge you and he got some of them, but... I will get stronger, Father. I will stamp them into dust. Hya! Hrah! Hoo-ah! I will kill them all!!
(Krista enters the scene.)
Krista: Chell? Was that you just now?
Chell: What? Oh, it's you, Your Highness. Pardon me. Let me get my shirt on.
Krista: There's no need. It's just us, and none of the men are around. What are you doing training so late? And all that yelling earlier... I caught some of it, but...
Chell: I had a nightmare about that day and I couldn't go back to sleep. Sometimes when I'm too angry or restless, I come here and train. Really train. Holding nothing back. But I get really sweaty and build up quite the heat, so I only do training like this at night.Krista

Krista: Hey, Chell! I wasn't expecting to meet my favorite Pegasus knight here.
Chell: Heh. You say that to every knight in your service, but thank you. I like to relax in the sauna after a good training session. 
Krista: Same here. Your shoulders look great! I didn't realize how good they were.
Chell: Please, Your Highness. On that note, your back is looking good. How is your swordsmanship with Kai going?
Krista: Going good! He's very quick with a blade. Speaking of which, how's your axe training going?
Chell: It's going well. It must be where the shoulder muscles are coming from. Anyway, if you ever want to train together, I'm at your service. I'm sure we could learn a lot from each other. 
Krista: Sure! I'd like that. Besides, I can see your thunder thighs in action.
Chell: Your thighs are pretty good as well, Your Highness. I'll see you next time.

Krista: Off to the sauna again, Chell?
Chell: Why, yes. Would you like to join me?
Krista: Yeah, I'd love to!
(Scene transitions to the sauna.)
Krista: Man, I didn't think it'd be possible, but I think you got even buffer since the last time we were in the sauna together.
Chell: Hm? I might be. I have been incorporating more meat into my diet. And with all the extra training and practice spars, it's not too surprising. On that note, you've been getting more muscle definition as well. Your back muscles especially.
Krista: Really? I can't get a good look at them myself, so I'll take your word for it.
Chell: Speaking of training, still going well, I take it?
Krista: No complaints here!
Chell: That's good. You know, despite you switching teachers multiple times, I can still see my father's influence on your technique.
Krista: Oh?
Chell: Your defensive maneuvers are similar to Forrest's. And you've gotten more swift with the blade after Kai started to teach you. However, the power you put into your swings was something my father advised to you, wasn't it?

Krista: Off to the sauna again, Chell?
Chell: Why, yes. Would you like to join me?
Krista: Yeah, I'd love to!
(Scene transitions to the sauna.)
Krista: Man, I didn't think it'd be possible, but I think you got even buffer since the last time we were in the sauna together.
Chell: Hm? I might be. I have been incorporating more meat into my diet. And with all the extra training and practice spars, it's not too surprising. On that note, you've been getting more muscle definition as well. Your back muscles especially.
Krista: Really? I can't get a good look at them myself, so I'll take your word for it.
Chell: Speaking of training, still going well, I take it?
Krista: No complaints here!
Chell: That's good. You know, despite you switching teachers multiple times, I can still see my father's influence on your technique.
Krista: Oh?
Chell: Your defensive maneuvers are similar to Forrest's. And you've gotten more swift with the blade after Kai started to teach you. However, the power you put into your swings was something my father advised to you, wasn't it?
Krista: Sure was. Ol' man Gibson always did say the best defense is a good offense.
Chell: Yes, that sounds like something Father would say.
Krista: ...
Chell: Your Highness?
Krista: Gibson was a good man. I still miss him, but it must be a lot tougher for you.
Chell: That is true. I miss him dearly. But I cannot let that weigh down on me. I won't allow it to.

Chell: Father, why? Why did you have to die like that? You were so strong. Sam tried to avenge you and he got some of them, but... I will get stronger, Father. I will stamp them into dust. Hya! Hrah! Hoo-ah! I will kill them all!!
(Krista enters the scene.)
Krista: Chell? Was that you just now?
Chell: What? Oh, it's you, Your Highness. Pardon me. Let me get my shirt on.
Krista: There's no need. It's just us, and none of the men are around. What are you doing training so late? And all that yelling earlier... I caught some of it, but...
Chell: I had a nightmare about that day and I couldn't go back to sleep. Sometimes when I'm too angry or restless, I come here and train. Really train. Holding nothing back. But I get really sweaty and build up quite the heat, so I only do training like this at night.Krista

Krista: Hey, Chell! I wasn't expecting to meet my favorite Pegasus knight here.
Chell: Heh. You say that to every knight in your service, but thank you. I like to relax in the sauna after a good training session. 
Krista: Same here. Your shoulders look great! I didn't realize how good they were.
Chell: Please, Your Highness. On that note, your back is looking good. How is your swordsmanship with Kai going?
Krista: Going good! He's very quick with a blade. Speaking of which, how's your axe training going?
Chell: It's going well. It must be where the shoulder muscles are coming from. Anyway, if you ever want to train together, I'm at your service. I'm sure we could learn a lot from each other. 
Krista: Sure! I'd like that. Besides, I can see your thunder thighs in action.
Chell: Your thighs are pretty good as well, Your Highness. I'll see you next time.

Krista: Off to the sauna again, Chell?
Chell: Why, yes. Would you like to join me?
Krista: Yeah, I'd love to!
(Scene transitions to the sauna.)
Krista: Man, I didn't think it'd be possible, but I think you got even buffer since the last time we were in the sauna together.
Chell: Hm? I might be. I have been incorporating more meat into my diet. And with all the extra training and practice spars, it's not too surprising. On that note, you've been getting more muscle definition as well. Your back muscles especially.
Krista: Really? I can't get a good look at them myself, so I'll take your word for it.
Chell: Speaking of training, still going well, I take it?
Krista: No complaints here!
Chell: That's good. You know, despite you switching teachers multiple times, I can still see my father's influence on your technique.
Krista: Oh?
Chell: Your defensive maneuvers are similar to Forrest's. And you've gotten more swift with the blade after Kai started to teach you. However, the power you put into your swings was something my father advised to you, wasn't it?
Krista: Sure was. Ol' man Gibson always did say the best defense is a good offense.
Chell: Yes, that sounds like something Father would say.
Krista: ...
Chell: Your Highness?
Krista: Gibson was a good man. I still miss him, but it must be a lot tougher for you.
Chell: That is true. I miss him dearly. But I cannot let that weigh down on me. I won't allow it to.

Chell: Father, why? Why did you have to die like that? You were so strong. Sam tried to avenge you and he got some of them, but... I will get stronger, Father. I will stamp them into dust. Hya! Hrah! Hoo-ah! I will kill them all!!
(Krista enters the scene.)
Krista: Chell? Was that you just now?
Chell: What? Oh, it's you, Your Highness. Pardon me. Let me get my shirt on.
Krista: There's no need. It's just us, and none of the men are around. What are you doing training so late? And all that yelling earlier... I caught some of it, but...
Chell: I had a nightmare about that day and I couldn't go back to sleep. Sometimes when I'm too angry or restless, I come here and train. Really train. Holding nothing back. But I get really sweaty and build up quite the heat, so I only do training like this at night.Krista

Chell: I had a nightmare about that day and I couldn't go back to sleep. Sometimes when I'm too angry or restless, I come here and train. Really train. Holding nothing back. But I get really sweaty and build up quite the heat, so I only do training like this at night.Krista

Krista: Hey, Chell! I wasn't expecting to meet my favorite Pegasus knight here.
Chell: Heh. You say that to every knight in your service, but thank you. I like to relax in the sauna after a good training session. 
Krista: Same here. Your shoulders look great! I didn't realize how good they were.
Chell: Please, Your Highness. On that note, your back is looking good. How is your swordsmanship with Kai going?
Krista: Going good! He's very quick with a blade. Speaking of which, how's your axe training going?
Chell: It's going well. It must be where the shoulder muscles are coming from. Anyway, if you ever want to train together, I'm at your service. I'm sure we could learn a lot from each other. 
Krista: Sure! I'd like that. Besides, I can see your thunder thighs in action.
Chell: Your thighs are pretty good as well, Your Highness. I'll see you next time.

Krista: Off to the sauna again, Chell?
Chell: Why, yes. Would you like to join me?
Krista: Yeah, I'd love to!
(Scene transitions to the sauna.)
Krista: Man, I didn't think it'd be possible, but I think you got even buffer since the last time we were in the sauna together.
Chell: Hm? I might be. I have been incorporating more meat into my diet. And with all the extra training and practice spars, it's not too surprising. On that note, you've been getting more muscle definition as well. Your back muscles especially.
Krista: Really? I can't get a good look at them myself, so I'll take your word for it.
Chell: Speaking of training, still going well, I take it?
Krista: No complaints here!
Chell: That's good. You know, despite you switching teachers multiple times, I can still see my father's influence on your technique.
Krista: Oh?
Chell: Your defensive maneuvers are similar to Forrest's. And you've gotten more swift with the blade after Kai started to teach you. However, the power you put into your swings was something my father advised to you, wasn't it?
Krista: Sure was. Ol' man Gibson always did say the best defense is a good offense.
Chell: Yes, that sounds like something Father would say.
Krista: ...
Chell: Your Highness?
Krista: Gibson was a good man. I still miss him, but it must be a lot tougher for you.
Chell: That is true. I miss him dearly. But I cannot let that weigh down on me. I won't allow it to.

Chell: Speaking of training, still going well, I take it?
Krista: No complaints here!
Chell: That's good. You know, despite you switching teachers multiple times, I can still see my father's influence on your technique.
Krista: Oh?
Chell: Your defensive maneuvers are similar to Forrest's. And you've gotten more swift with the blade after Kai started to teach you. However, the power you put into your swings was something my father advised to you, wasn't it?
Krista: Sure was. Ol' man Gibson always did say the best defense is a good offense.
Chell: Yes, that sounds like something Father would say.
Krista: ...
Chell: Your Highness?
Krista: Gibson was a good man. I still miss him, but it must be a lot tougher for you.
Chell: That is true. I miss him dearly. But I cannot let that weigh down on me. I won't allow it to.
Krista: Chell...

Chell: Father, why? Why did you have to die like that? You were so strong. Sam tried to avenge you and he got some of them, but... I will get stronger, Father. I will stamp them into dust. Hya! Hrah! Hoo-ah! I will kill them all!!
(Krista enters the scene.)
Krista: Chell? Was that you just now?
Chell: What? Oh, it's you, Your Highness. Pardon me. Let me get my shirt on.
Krista: There's no need. It's just us, and none of the men are around. What are you doing training so late? And all that yelling earlier... I caught some of it, but...
Chell: I had a nightmare about that day and I couldn't go back to sleep. Sometimes when I'm too angry or restless, I come here and train. Really train. Holding nothing back. But I get really sweaty and build up quite the heat, so I only do training like this at night.Krista

Getting rid of evil-doers is good on paper, but you gotta think about the motivation behind the act, too. {c:e;Krista;HalfCloseEyes}I just don't want to let you lose yourself to your anger, Chell. You might end up doing something you regret.

Krista: Hey, Chell! I wasn't expecting to meet my favorite Pegasus knight here.
Chell: Heh. You say that to every knight in your service, but thank you. I like to relax in the sauna after a good training session. 
Krista: Same here. Your shoulders look great! I didn't realize how good they were.
Chell: Please, Your Highness. On that note, your back is looking good. How is your swordsmanship with Kai going?
Krista: Going good! He's very quick with a blade. Speaking of which, how's your axe training going?
Chell: It's going well. It must be where the shoulder muscles are coming from. Anyway, if you ever want to train together, I'm at your service. I'm sure we could learn a lot from each other. 
Krista: Sure! I'd like that. Besides, I can see your thunder thighs in action.

Krista: Hey, Chell! I wasn't expecting to meet my favorite Pegasus knight here.
Chell: Heh. You say that to every knight in your service, but thank you. I like to relax in the sauna after a good training session. 
Krista: Same here. Your shoulders look great! I didn't realize how good they were.
Chell: Please, Your Highness. On that note, your back is looking good. How is your swordsmanship with Kai going?
Krista: Going good! He's very quick with a blade. Speaking of which, how's your axe training going?
Chell: It's going well. It must be where the shoulder muscles are coming from. Anyway, if you ever want to train together, I'm at your service. I'm sure we could learn a lot from each other. 
Krista: Sure! I'd like that. Besides, I can see your thunder thighs in action.
Chell: Your thighs are pretty good as well, Your Highness. I'll see you next time.

Krista: Off to the sauna again, Chell?
Chell: Why, yes. Would you like to join me?
Krista: Yeah, I'd love to!
(Scene transitions to the sauna.)
Krista: Man, I didn't think it'd be possible, but I think you got even buffer since the last time we were in the sauna together.
Chell: Hm? I might be. I have been incorporating more meat into my diet. And with all the extra training and practice spars, it's not too surprising. On that note, you've been getting more muscle definition as well. Your back muscles especially.
Krista: Really? I can't get a good look at them myself, so I'll take your word for it.
Chell: Speaking of training, still going well, I take it?
Krista: No complaints here!
Chell: That's good. You know, despite you switching teachers multiple times, I can still see my father's influence on your technique.
Krista: Oh?
Chell: Your defensive maneuvers are similar to Forrest's. And you've gotten more swift with the blade after Kai started to teach you. However, the power you put into your swings was something my father advised to you, wasn't it?
Krista: Sure was. Ol' man Gibson always did say the best defense is a good offense.
Chell: Yes, that sounds like something Father would say.
Krista: ...
Chell: Your Highness?
Krista: Gibson was a good man. I still miss him, but it must be a lot tougher for you.
Chell: That is true. I miss him dearly. But I cannot let that weigh down on me. I won't allow it to.
Krista: Chell...

Chell: Father, why? Why did you have to die like that? You were so strong. Sam tried to avenge you and he got some of them, but... I will get stronger, Father. I will stamp them into dust. Hya! Hrah! Hoo-ah! I will kill them all!!
(Krista enters the scene.)
Krista: Chell? Was that you just now?
Chell: What? Oh, it's you, Your Highness. Pardon me. Let me get my shirt on.
Krista: There's no need. It's just us, and none of the men are around. What are you doing training so late? And all that yelling earlier... I caught some of it, but...
Chell: I had a nightmare about that day and I couldn't go back to sleep. Sometimes when I'm too angry or restless, I come here and train. Really train. Holding nothing back. But I get really sweaty and build up quite the heat, so I only do training like this at night.Krista

Getting rid of evil-doers is good on paper, but you gotta think about the motivation behind the act, too. {c:e;Krista;HalfCloseEyes}I just don't want to let you lose yourself to your anger, Chell. You might end up doing something you regret.
Chell: I... I understand, Your Highness.

Krista: Hey, Chell! I wasn't expecting to meet my favorite Pegasus knight here.
Chell: Heh. You say that to every knight in your service, but thank you. I like to relax in the sauna after a good training session. 
Krista: Same here. Your shoulders look great! I didn't realize how good they were.
Chell: Please, Your Highness. On that note, your back is looking good. How is your swordsmanship with Kai going?
Krista: Going good! He's very quick with a blade. Speaking of which, how's your axe training going?
Chell: It's going well. It must be where the shoulder muscles are coming from. Anyway, if you ever want to train together, I'm at your service. I'm sure we could learn a lot from each other. 
Krista: Sure! I'd like that. Besides, I can see your thunder thighs in action.
Chell: Your thighs are pretty good as well, Your Highness. I'll see you next time.

Krista: Off to the sauna again, Chell?
Chell: Why, yes. Would you like to join me?
Krista: Yeah, I'd love to!
(Scene transitions to the sauna.)
Krista: Man, I didn't think it'd be possible, but I think you got even buffer since the last time we were in the sauna together.
Chell: Hm? I might be. I have been incorporating more meat into my diet. And with all the extra training and practice spars, it's not too surprising. On that note, you've been getting more muscle definition as well. Your back muscles especially.
Krista: Really? I can't get a good look at them myself, so I'll take your word for it.
Chell: Speaking of training, still going well, I take it?
Krista: No complaints here!
Chell: That's good. You know, despite you switching teachers multiple times, I can still see my father's influence on your technique.
Krista: Oh?
Chell: Your defensive maneuvers are similar to Forrest's. And you've gotten more swift with the blade after Kai started to teach you. However, the power you put into your swings was something my father advised to you, wasn't it?
Krista: Sure was. Ol' man Gibson always did say the best defense is a good offense.
Chell: Yes, that sounds like something Father would say.
Krista: ...
Chell: Your Highness?
Krista: Gibson was a good man. I still miss him, but it must be a lot tougher for you.
Chell: That is true. I miss him dearly. But I cannot let that weigh down on me. I won't allow it to.

Krista: Chell? Was that you just now?
Chell: What? Oh, it's you, Your Highness. Pardon me. Let me get my shirt on.

Chell: I had a nightmare about that day and I couldn't go back to sleep. Sometimes when I'm too angry or restless, I come here and train. Really train. Holding nothing back. But I get really sweaty and build up quite the heat, so I only do training like this at night.Krista

Chell: Father, why? Why did you have to die like that? You were so strong. Sam tried to avenge you and he got some of them, but... I will get stronger, Father. I will stamp them into dust. Hya! Hrah! Hoo-ah! I will kill them all!!
(Krista enters the scene.)
Krista: Chell? Was that you just now?
Chell: What? Oh, it's you, Your Highness. Pardon me. Let me get my shirt on.
Krista: There's no need. It's just us, and none of the men are around. What are you doing training so late? And all that yelling earlier... I caught some of it, but...
Chell: I had a nightmare about that day and I couldn't go back to sleep. Sometimes when I'm too angry or restless, I come here and train. Really train. Holding nothing back. But I get really sweaty and build up quite the heat, so I only do training like this at night.Krista

Krista: Hey, Chell! I wasn't expecting to meet my favorite Pegasus knight here.
Chell: Heh. You say that to every knight in your service, but thank you. I like to relax in the sauna after a good training session. 
Krista: Same here. Your shoulders look great! I didn't realize how good they were.
Chell: Please, Your Highness. On that note, your back is looking good. How is your swordsmanship with Kai going?
Krista: Going good! He's very quick with a blade. Speaking of which, how's your axe training going?
Chell: It's going well. It must be where the shoulder muscles are coming from. Anyway, if you ever want to train together, I'm at your service. I'm sure we could learn a lot from each other. 
Krista: Sure! I'd like that. Besides, I can see your thunder thighs in action.

Chell: Why, yes. Would you like to join me?
Krista: Yeah, I'd love to!
(Scene transitions to the sauna.)
Krista: Man, I didn't think it'd be possible, but I think you got even buffer since the last time we were in the sauna together.
Chell: Hm? I might be. I have been incorporating more meat into my diet. And with all the extra training and practice spars, it's not too surprising. On that note, you've been getting more muscle definition as well. Your back muscles especially.
Krista: Really? I can't get a good look at them myself, so I'll take your word for it.
Chell: Speaking of training, still going well, I take it?
Krista: No complaints here!
Chell: That's good. You know, despite you switching teachers multiple times, I can still see my father's influence on your technique.
Krista: Oh?
Chell: Your defensive maneuvers are similar to Forrest's. And you've gotten more swift with the blade after Kai started to teach you. However, the power you put into your swings was something my father advised to you, wasn't it?
Krista: Sure was. Ol' man Gibson always did say the best defense is a good offense.
Chell: Yes, that sounds like something Father would say.
Krista: ...
Chell: Your Highness?
Krista: Gibson was a good man. I still miss him, but it must be a lot tougher for you.

Krista: Man, I didn't think it'd be possible, but I think you got even buffer since the last time we were in the sauna together.
Chell: Hm? I might be. I have been incorporating more meat into my diet. And with all the extra training and practice spars, it's not too surprising. On that note, you've been getting more muscle definition as well. Your back muscles especially.
Krista: Really? I can't get a good look at them myself, so I'll take your word for it.
Chell: Speaking of training, still going well, I take it?
Krista: No complaints here!
Chell: That's good. You know, despite you switching teachers multiple times, I can still see my father's influence on your technique.
Krista: Oh?
Chell: Your defensive maneuvers are similar to Forrest's. And you've gotten more swift with the blade after Kai started to teach you. However, the power you put into your swings was something my father advised to you, wasn't it?
Krista: Sure was. Ol' man Gibson always did say the best defense is a good offense.
Chell: Yes, that sounds like something Father would say.
Krista: ...
Chell: Your Highness?
Krista: Gibson was a good man. I still miss him, but it must be a lot tougher for you.
Chell: That is true. I miss him dearly. But I cannot let that weigh down on me. I won't allow it to.
Krista: Chell...

Chell: Father, why? Why did you have to die like that? You were so strong. Sam tried to avenge you and he got some of them, but... I will get stronger, Father. I will stamp them into dust. Hya! Hrah! Hoo-ah! I will kill them all!!
(Krista enters the scene.)
Krista: Chell? Was that you just now?
Chell: What? Oh, it's you, Your Highness. Pardon me. Let me get my shirt on.
Krista: There's no need. It's just us, and none of the men are around. What are you doing training so late? And all that yelling earlier... I caught some of it, but...
Chell: I had a nightmare about that day and I couldn't go back to sleep. Sometimes when I'm too angry or restless, I come here and train. Really train. Holding nothing back. But I get really sweaty and build up quite the heat, so I only do training like this at night.Krista

Chell: Your Highness...{e:"" if {v:TruthPlot} == True else "?"}

Getting rid of evil-doers is good on paper, but you gotta think about the motivation behind the act, too. {c:e;Krista;HalfCloseEyes}I just don't want to let you lose yourself to your anger, Chell. You might end up doing something you regret.
Chell: I... I understand, Your Highness.

Chell: Heh. You say that to every knight in your service, but thank you. I like to relax in the sauna after a good training session. 
Krista: Same here. Your shoulders look great! I didn't realize how good they were.
Chell: Please, Your Highness. On that note, your back is looking good. How is your swordsmanship with Kai going?
Krista: Going good! He's very quick with a blade. Speaking of which, how's your axe training going?
Chell: It's going well. It must be where the shoulder muscles are coming from. Anyway, if you ever want to train together, I'm at your service. I'm sure we could learn a lot from each other. 
Krista: Sure! I'd like that. Besides, I can see your thunder thighs in action.

Krista: Hey, Chell! I wasn't expecting to meet my favorite Pegasus knight here.
Chell: Heh. You say that to every knight in your service, but thank you. I like to relax in the sauna after a good training session. 
Krista: Same here. Your shoulders look great! I didn't realize how good they were.
Chell: Please, Your Highness. On that note, your back is looking good. How is your swordsmanship with Kai going?
Krista: Going good! He's very quick with a blade. Speaking of which, how's your axe training going?
Chell: It's going well. It must be where the shoulder muscles are coming from. Anyway, if you ever want to train together, I'm at your service. I'm sure we could learn a lot from each other. 
Krista: Sure! I'd like that. Besides, I can see your thunder thighs in action.
Chell: Your thighs are pretty good as well, Your Highness. I'll see you next time.

Krista: Off to the sauna again, Chell?
Chell: Why, yes. Would you like to join me?
Krista: Yeah, I'd love to!
(Scene transitions to the sauna.)
Krista: Man, I didn't think it'd be possible, but I think you got even buffer since the last time we were in the sauna together.
Chell: Hm? I might be. I have been incorporating more meat into my diet. And with all the extra training and practice spars, it's not too surprising. On that note, you've been getting more muscle definition as well. Your back muscles especially.
Krista: Really? I can't get a good look at them myself, so I'll take your word for it.
Chell: Speaking of training, still going well, I take it?
Krista: No complaints here!
Chell: That's good. You know, despite you switching teachers multiple times, I can still see my father's influence on your technique.
Krista: Oh?
Chell: Your defensive maneuvers are similar to Forrest's. And you've gotten more swift with the blade after Kai started to teach you. However, the power you put into your swings was something my father advised to you, wasn't it?
Krista: Sure was. Ol' man Gibson always did say the best defense is a good offense.
Chell: Yes, that sounds like something Father would say.
Krista: ...
Chell: Your Highness?
Krista: Gibson was a good man. I still miss him, but it must be a lot tougher for you.
Chell: That is true. I miss him dearly. But I cannot let that weigh down on me. I won't allow it to.

Chell: Father, why? Why did you have to die like that? You were so strong. Sam tried to avenge you and he got some of them, but... I will get stronger, Father. I will stamp them into dust. Hya! Hrah! Hoo-ah! I will kill them all!!
(Krista enters the scene.)
Krista: Chell? Was that you just now?
Chell: What? Oh, it's you, Your Highness. Pardon me. Let me get my shirt on.
Krista: There's no need. It's just us, and none of the men are around. What are you doing training so late? And all that yelling earlier... I caught some of it, but...
Chell: I had a nightmare about that day and I couldn't go back to sleep. Sometimes when I'm too angry or restless, I come here and train. Really train. Holding nothing back. But I get really sweaty and build up quite the heat, so I only do training like this at night.Krista

Chell: Why?

Getting rid of evil-doers is good on paper, but you gotta think about the motivation behind the act, too. {c:e;Krista;HalfCloseEyes}I just don't want to let you lose yourself to your anger, Chell. You might end up doing something you regret.
Chell: I... I understand, Your Highness.

Krista: Hey, Chell! I wasn't expecting to meet my favorite Pegasus knight here.
Chell: Heh. You say that to every knight in your service, but thank you. I like to relax in the sauna after a good training session. 
Krista: Same here. Your shoulders look great! I didn't realize how good they were.
Chell: Please, Your Highness. On that note, your back is looking good. How is your swordsmanship with Kai going?
Krista: Going good! He's very quick with a blade. Speaking of which, how's your axe training going?
Chell: It's going well. It must be where the shoulder muscles are coming from. Anyway, if you ever want to train together, I'm at your service. I'm sure we could learn a lot from each other. 
Krista: Sure! I'd like that. Besides, I can see your thunder thighs in action.
Chell: Your thighs are pretty good as well, Your Highness. I'll see you next time.

Krista: Off to the sauna again, Chell?
Chell: Why, yes. Would you like to join me?
Krista: Yeah, I'd love to!
(Scene transitions to the sauna.)
Krista: Man, I didn't think it'd be possible, but I think you got even buffer since the last time we were in the sauna together.
Chell: Hm? I might be. I have been incorporating more meat into my diet. And with all the extra training and practice spars, it's not too surprising. On that note, you've been getting more muscle definition as well. Your back muscles especially.
Krista: Really? I can't get a good look at them myself, so I'll take your word for it.
Chell: Speaking of training, still going well, I take it?
Krista: No complaints here!
Chell: That's good. You know, despite you switching teachers multiple times, I can still see my father's influence on your technique.
Krista: Oh?
Chell: Your defensive maneuvers are similar to Forrest's. And you've gotten more swift with the blade after Kai started to teach you. However, the power you put into your swings was something my father advised to you, wasn't it?
Krista: Sure was. Ol' man Gibson always did say the best defense is a good offense.
Chell: Yes, that sounds like something Father would say.
Krista: ...
Chell: Your Highness?
Krista: Gibson was a good man. I still miss him, but it must be a lot tougher for you.
Chell: That is true. I miss him dearly. But I cannot let that weigh down on me. I won't allow it to.
Krista: Chell...

Chell: Father, why? Why did you have to die like that? You were so strong. Sam tried to avenge you and he got some of them, but... I will get stronger, Father. I will stamp them into dust. Hya! Hrah! Hoo-ah! I will kill them all!!
(Krista enters the scene.)
Krista: Chell? Was that you just now?
Chell: What? Oh, it's you, Your Highness. Pardon me. Let me get my shirt on.
Krista: There's no need. It's just us, and none of the men are around. What are you doing training so late? And all that yelling earlier... I caught some of it, but...
Chell: I had a nightmare about that day and I couldn't go back to sleep. Sometimes when I'm too angry or restless, I come here and train. Really train. Holding nothing back. But I get really sweaty and build up quite the heat, so I only do training like this at night.Krista
