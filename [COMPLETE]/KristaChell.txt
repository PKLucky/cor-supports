speak;KristaShirtless;Hey, Chell!|I wasn't expecting to meet my favorite Pegasus knight here.
expression;ChellShirtless;Smile
speak;ChellShirtless;Heh. You say that to every knight in your service, but thank you.|I like to relax in the sauna after a good training session. 
speak;KristaShirtless;Same here.|Your shoulders look great! I didn't realize how good they were.
expression;ChellShirtless;CloseEyes
speak;ChellShirtless;Please, Your Highness.|{c:e;ChellShirtless;NormalBlink}On that note, your back is looking good.|How is your swordsmanship with Kai going?
speak;KristaShirtless;Going good! He's very quick with a blade.|Speaking of which, how's your axe training going?
expression;ChellShirtless;Smile
speak;ChellShirtless;It's going well. It must be where the shoulder muscles are coming from.|Anyway, if you ever want to train together, I'm at your service.|I'm sure we could learn a lot from each other. 
speak;KristaShirtless;Sure! I'd like that.|Besides, I can see your thunder thighs in action.
speak;ChellShirtless;Your thighs are pretty good as well, Your Highness. I'll see you next time.

speak;KristaShirtless;Man, I didn't think it'd be possible,|but I think you got even buffer since the last time we were in the sauna together.
speak;ChellShirtless;Hm? I might be. I have been incorporating more meat into my diet.|And with all the extra training and practice spars, it's not too surprising.|{c:e;ChellShirtless;Smile}On that note, you've been getting more muscle definition as well.|Your back muscles especially.
speak;KristaShirtless;Really?|I can't get a good look at them myself, so I'll take your word for it.
speak;ChellShirtless;Speaking of training, still going well, I take it?
expression;KristaShirtless;Smile
speak;KristaShirtless;No complaints here!
speak;ChellShirtless;That's good.|{c:e;ChellShirtless;NoSmile}You know, despite you switching teachers multiple times,|I can still see my father's influence on your technique.
expression;KristaShirtless;NoSmile
speak;KristaShirtless;Oh?
speak;ChellShirtless;Your defensive maneuvers are similar to Forrest's.|And you've gotten more swift with the blade after Kai started to teach you.|However, the power you put into your swings was something my father|advised to you, wasn't it?
expression;KristaShirtless;Smile
speak;KristaShirtless;Sure was.|Ol' man Gibson always did say the best defense is a good offense.

speak;ChellShirtless;Yes, that sounds like something Father would say.

speak;ChellShirtless;That is true. I miss him dearly.|But I cannot let that weigh down on me.|{c:e;ChellShirtless;CloseEyes}I won't allow it to.

speak;ChellShirtless;Oh, it's you, Your Highness. Pardon me. Let me get my shirt on.
speak;Krista;There's no need. It's just us, and none of the men are around.|What are you doing training so late?|{c:e;Krista;HalfCloseEyes}And all that yelling earlier{tgm}...{tgm} I caught some of it, but{tgm}...
expression;ChellShirtless;CloseEyes
speak;ChellShirtless;I had a nightmare about that day and I couldn't go back to sleep.|{c:e;ChellShirtless;NormalBlink}Sometimes when I'm too angry or restless, I come here and train.|Really train.

speak;Krista;You want those bandits killed, don't you?|{c:e;Krista;NormalBlink}It's not about justice. You want them dead and rotting somewhere, right?

speak;ChellShirtless;{tgm}...{tgm} Yes.|{c:e;ChellShirtless;HalfCloseEyes}I'm sad to say, but it's true.

speak;Krista;So, you getting as strong as you have, there's a drive behind it.
expression;ChellShirtless;NormalBlink
speak;ChellShirtless;Exactly.

speak;Krista;What I should do is reprimand you.|Tell you vengeance isn't the answer, blah, blah, blah.|{c:e;Krista;NormalBlink}I'm not gonna do that.
speak;ChellShirtless;Why?
expression;Krista;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Krista;Because I understand.|How sometimes anger boils up inside you and you gotta let it out somehow.|{c:e;Krista;CloseEyes}It's hard to keep that sort of thing down. Especially when it's that intense.

speak;Krista;All I ask is that you rethink your reasons for going after them.|Getting rid of evil-doers is good on paper,|but you gotta think about the motivation behind the act, too.|{c:e;Krista;HalfCloseEyes}I just don't want to let you lose yourself to your anger, Chell.|You might end up doing something you regret.
speak;ChellShirtless;I{tgm}...{tgm} I understand, Your Highness.
expression;Krista;NormalBlink
speak;Krista;You don't have to come to any conclusions right away.|But when you feel like you're ready,|I'll be there to back you up no matter what you end up deciding to do.
speak;ChellShirtless;Your Highness{tgm}...{tgm} Thank you.|I'll keep honing my strength until then.|{c:e;ChellShirtless;CloseEyes}One day, I will bring peace to my parents with no regrets.{c:e;ChellShirtless;NormalBlink}{c:wait;100} I swear it.
