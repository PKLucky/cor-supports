speak;Alex;Ah, General Forrest! Perfect timing.|Do you have a moment?
speak;Forrest;I do. Did you need something?
expression;Alex;NoSmile
speak;Alex;Yes. You see, back when your father led the royal army,|he taught the Lance Cavalry unit a certain technique.|I was just barely a squire back then, but I wanted to learn it myself when the time came.
speak;Forrest;I see.
speak;Alex;I have been looking over this combat manual he wrote,|but I'm not sure if I'm performing the actions detailed in it correctly.|Do you mind looking it over while you observe my and Tia's movements?|I could really use an outside perspective.

speak;Alex;I've noticed that you've been more focused on your swordplay than|your lance techniques lately.|Is there any particular reason for that?
speak;Forrest;While I have maintained my lance skills in my free time,|I feel compelled to improve my swordsmanship more.|Maybe even have it surpass my lance prowess.
speak;Alex;Oh?|{c:e;Alex;HalfCloseEyes,Smile}Fascinating. Very fascinating.
