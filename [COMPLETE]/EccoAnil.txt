expression;Ecco;NoSmile
speak;Ecco;The bakery? Man, I knew I should have checked there first.|But what were you doing there in the first place?
speak;Anil;[You seemed anxious lately, so I wanted to get you something to cheer you up.]|[The baker recognized me, so she asked me to give the amulet back to you.]
expression;Ecco;Smile
speak;Ecco;Thanks again, Anil. This is a huge load off my mind.
speak;Anil;[Well, you seem in good spirits now,]|[so I'll be taking this slice of cherry pie the baker gave me.]

speak;Ecco;That amulet was given to me by the bishops back when I was a monk.|I'm not a devout follower of Oreg anymore,|so what was the point of keeping it around, right?
speak;Anil;[Right?]
expression;Ecco;CloseEyes
speak;Ecco;But at the same time, it reminds me of all the friends I made back at the temple,|so it's still important to me.|{c:e;Ecco;HalfCloseEyes}I don't really know what to do with it{tgm}...
speak;Anil;[Judging by your reaction when I returned it to you, I think the answer's pretty obvious.]
expression;Ecco;NormalBlink
speak;Ecco;Yeah, you're right. I'll have to keep it somewhere safer from now on.
