speak;Kai;Trevor, there you are.|Mind if I ask you about something?
expression;Trevor;Smile
speak;Trevor;Kai, my brother in arms, you may ask me anything your heart desires.
speak;Kai;Great. Just to confirm, Princess Krista hired you around six months ago?
speak;Trevor;Why, yes! Only two months after your employment, if memory serves.
speak;Kai;I see. With that in mind, your prowess with magic piqued my interest.
speak;Trevor;You flatter me so, Kai!|{c:e;Trevor;NoSmile}But, I have a feeling that this is where the praise ends.
expression;Kai;CloseEyes,Smile
speak;Kai;And you'd be right.|{c:e;Kai;NormalBlink,NoSmile}You see, I've heard rumors that House Valoria's only child has gone missing.|{c:e;Kai;HalfCloseEyes}And has been missing for around six months.
speak;Trevor;I see. Go on.
expression;Kai;NormalBlink
speak;Kai;Being a magic prodigy yourself,|I'm sure you'd know about the most powerful mage family in Medeas, wouldn't you?
speak;Trevor;Well{tgm}...{tgm} of course! Now, Kai, excuse me for being presumptuous,|but I am not the missing Valoria heir of which you speak.|For the Valoria family only had a daughter, not a son.|It would be impossible for it to be me.
speak;Kai;Huh. Well, that's news to me.|Sorry about the assumptions, Trevor.|I guess I'll have to go back to the drawing board for this one.
speak;Trevor;It is quite alright, my friend.|I would love to chat more, but I must get to my studies.|{c:e;Trevor;Smile}Do not get too caught up in the rumor mill, now.
