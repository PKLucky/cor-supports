speak;Krista;Thanks! You're pretty good yourself, as usual.
speak;Kai;I believe we deserve a break after such a good spar.

speak;Kai;Say, I've been curious about something.
speak;Krista;Yes?
speak;Kai;Your sword skills are decent, but what about other weapons?|I heard that Medeans of the royal bloodline are trained to use weapons of all kinds.
speak;Krista;Yeah, that's true, but{tgm}...{tgm}|When Chell's parents were still around, they taught me the sword and lance.|Then Forrest took over after they passed away.|And back when Sam was around, he tried to teach me stuff about axes.|{c:e;Krista;CloseEyes}And don't even get me started on magic.|That went absolutely nowhere.|{c:e;Krista;NormalBlink}Even though none of those things stuck with me,|I was pretty decent with a bow back in the day.|Though, it's been a while since I've used one.
speak;Kai;The bow? Who taught you archery?
speak;Krista;Oh. Um. Prince Ervan, actually{tgm}...

speak;Krista;Forrest says I gotta brush up on my history knowledge.|He caught me in a "no study" mood, so I'm not gonna bother.|{c:e;Krista;Smile}The least I can do is PRETEND to study.
expression;Kai;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Kai;{tgm}...{tgm} I see.
speak;Krista;But enough about what I'm supposed to be doing but not actually doing.|What are you up to?

speak;Krista;Hey, wait a sec. That's a book on the Medean royal family!|You should've come to me if you wanted some info.|Get it straight from the source!

expression;Krista;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Krista;{tgm}...{tgm} Okay, fair.|{c:e;Krista;NormalBlink}Still, I can probably help with your research! Even if it's something small.
expression;Kai;NormalBlink
speak;Kai;Well, since you're offering,|I'm curious about the arranged marriages within the royal family.
expression;Krista;Smile
speak;Krista;You got it! Lucky for you, I actually know a lot about this.|{c:e;Krista;NoSmile}I'm sure Yondo's other royal families got the whole arranged marriage thing too,|but Medeas has a whole system on how to choose the heir's partner.
speak;Kai;Oh?
speak;Krista;You probably noticed when looking down the family tree,|but there's a cyclical pattern going on with the betrothed's home nation.
speak;Kai;Yes, I did notice that. I assume this has to do with Medeas' public relations?
expression;Krista;Smile
speak;Krista;You got it!|{c:e;Krista;NoSmile}My ancestors figured out this system so that one nation wouldn't|be favored over the other when it came time for a political marriage.
speak;Kai;Interesting{tgm}...{tgm} So, according to this, your father married a priestess from Foliaga.
expression;Krista;Smile
speak;Krista;Yup! With Foliaga being the previous nation in the cycle,|that means Fuegsol would have been next in line.
speak;Kai;So, Prince Ervan was{tgm}...

speak;Krista;S-Sorry, uh. Anything else you needed, Kai?
speak;Kai;One last thing, if you don't mind.
speak;Krista;Uh-huh?
speak;Kai;Dumb question, but how much did Prince Ervan mean to you?
speak;Krista;He was everything to me, Kai. I loved him more than anything.|And I know that he felt the same.|{c:e;Krista;CloseEyes}I miss him so, so much.
speak;Kai;I see.{c:e;Kai;Smile} Thanks for your time, Princess.|You've been a great help.

speak;Kai;Something on your mind?

speak;Kai;Of course I do.|Just bumped into you, Forrest, and Felicity one day while|you were shopping in the castle town's marketplace.
expression;Krista;CloseEyes
speak;Krista;"Just bumped into us."|{c:e;Krista;HalfCloseEyes}If you told me that months ago, I would've believed you.
speak;Kai;What if I said that was actually the truth?

speak;Krista;I'd say you're full of shit.
expression;Kai;CloseEyes,Smile
speak;Kai;Heh, and you'd be right.
expression;Krista;NoSmile,NormalBlink
speak;Krista;So, what's the deal, then?|Considering all that snooping you've been doing since you got here,|you're obviously trying to get info on something.

speak;Kai;Alright, you got me.|{c:e;Kai;NoSmile}But if you knew I was trying to find something,|why didn't you do anything about it?

expression;Kai;HalfCloseEyes,Smile
speak;Kai;A bit too trusting, are we?
speak;Krista;Maybe.{c:e;Krista;HalfCloseEyes,Smile} You still haven't done anything yet, though.|{c:e;Krista;CloseEyes,Smile}We've known each other for almost a year now, Kai.|You've got an ample amount of info to blackmail me with now, don't you?|{c:e;Krista;HalfCloseEyes,Smile}If you really wanted to, you could do just that.|Makes me wonder just what you're after.

speak;Kai;Well, well. Guess I've underestimated you, Princess.|{c:e;Kai;NoSmile,CloseEyes}Hmm{tgm}...{c:e;Kai;NormalBlink,Smile}{tgm} You know what? I'm feeling nice. I'll give you a hint.
