speak;Krista;So, uh, wanna hang out or something?
expression;Semi;CloseEyes
speak;Semi;...;no_talk
speak;Krista;We could sit around in the courtyard.|Or maybe have some quiet time in the library?

speak;Krista;Or! We could eat at the dining hall!|I heard the cooks got some really good mutton today!

speak;Semi;I'll use small words so you can understand.{c:w;100}{c:e;Semi;NormalBlink} No.
expression;Krista;HalfCloseEyes,Smile
speak;Krista;Technically, that was only one small word.
expression;Semi;CloseEyes
speak;Semi;For the love of{tgm}...{tgm}|{c:e;Semi;NormalBlink}Why the hell do you want to spend time with me so badly?
expression;Krista;NoSmile,NormalBlink
speak;Krista;Well, since we're working together and all,|I figured we could try to be friends?|{c:e;Krista;HalfCloseEyes}Since--let's be real--you've been hostile to me ever since we met.
speak;Semi;Oh, so you finally notice.
expression;Krista;NormalBlink
speak;Krista;Look, I just wanna know why.|I haven't done anything to you.
speak;Semi;It doesn't matter if you did anything or not.|Just leave me alone.

speak;Krista;Hi, Semi!
speak;Semi;How many times have I told you to leave me alone?
expression;Krista;NoSmile
speak;Krista;I can probably count how many on both hands.
speak;Semi;The correct answer is too many.
expression;Krista;CloseEyes
speak;Krista;And yet nothing has changed.|{c:e;Krista;HalfCloseEyes,Smile}Semi, my friend-not-friend, we have reached a standstill.
expression;Semi;CloseEyes
speak;Semi;Ugh{tgm}...{c:e;Semi;NormalBlink}{tgm} Look, if I tell you why I don't like you, will you leave me alone?
expression;Krista;NormalBlink,NoSmile
speak;Krista;Can't guarantee it, but I might if the reason sounds valid.
speak;Semi;Alright. Don't expect me to pull any punches here.
speak;Krista;Not like you ever did with me in the first place.|Go for it. I can take it.
expression;Semi;CloseEyes
speak;Semi;Don't say I didn't warn you.|{c:e;Semi;NormalBlink}So, I lived with my mother for most of my life here in Medeas.|We lived out in the countryside.|She was a weaver and sold the tapestries she made to keep us fed.
speak;Krista;What about your father?
speak;Semi;He left us before I was even born. My mother never talked about him beyond that.|{c:e;Semi;CloseEyes}My mother{tgm}...{tgm} She was all I had.
speak;Krista;{tgm}...{tgm} What happened to her?
expression;Semi;NormalBlink
speak;Semi;Arrested for blasphemy.
speak;Krista;What?
speak;Semi;You heard me.|Thrown in the dungeons just because one of her tapestries depicted Medea wrong.|I know his body looked a little off,|but that shouldn't be something someone should be arrested for!
speak;Krista;His body{tgm}...?
expression;Semi;CloseEyes
speak;Semi;It doesn't matter now.|{c:e;Semi;NormalBlink}Your family took my mother away from me for such a stupid reason!|I can never forgive any of you for this.|{c:e;Semi;CloseEyes}She was all I had and now she's gone.
expression;Krista;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Krista;Semi{tgm}...
expression;Semi;NormalBlink
speak;Semi;And that's it. Everything I loved was stripped from me.|And it's all your family's fault.|{c:e;Semi;HalfCloseEyes}There. Happy?

speak;Krista;About your mother, I talked things over with the dungeon guards.|{c:e;Krista;Smile}Long story short, your mother's a free woman.

mirror_portrait;Semi
speak;Semi;What?
speak;Krista;Yup. They let her go.|I told them what you told me, and they let her go free.|{c:e;Krista;NoSmile}Unfortunately and unsurprisingly, your mother was in bad shape,|so I'm having our clerics look after her 'til she gets better.|{c:e;Krista;Smile}Once she's back on her feet, we're sending her back home.
speak;Semi;You{tgm}...{tgm} You seriously did that?
speak;Krista;Yeah, of course!|She shouldn't have been arrested in the first place.
speak;Semi;Why bother going through all that trouble, though?|You did this for a complete stranger.|A complete stranger who allegedly was a criminal, no less.
expression;Krista;NoSmile
speak;Krista;It was the right thing to do.|And I can understand what you went through.|It's hard losing someone you love too soon.|{c:e;Krista;CloseEyes}I know the feeling too well.
speak;Semi;...;no_talk
expression;Krista;NormalBlink
speak;Krista;Unlike me, you have an opportunity to see her again.|I wouldn't want to take that away from you.|{c:e;Krista;CloseEyes}I know this won't make up for the years she was gone,|but now you'll have something to go back to once this is all over.
speak;Semi;...;no_talk
expression;Krista;NormalBlink
speak;Krista;Anyway, that's all I wanted to talk to you about.|See ya later.
