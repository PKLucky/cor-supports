speak;Lucy;This is really good! What kind of tea is it?
expression;Alex;NoSmile
speak;Alex;It's a blend of chamomile and lavender.|I've read that both are good for sleep and relaxation.
speak;Lucy;That's amazing! Tea can do that?
speak;Alex;Yes, to some extent.|It can't replace eating well and taking care of your body, but it can help.|If you'd like, I could lend you my book on different teas.|You seem quite interested.
speak;Lucy;That would be great! Thank you very much, Miss Alex!
expression;Alex;Smile
speak;Alex;Of course.|If you happen to come across a tea that you might like, let me know.|I'll see if I can brew it for you.
speak;Lucy;Okay!

speak;Lucy;Miss Alex! I found a tea I want to try.
speak;Alex;Oh? Which one is it?
speak;Lucy;Ginger tea!
expression;Alex;Smile
speak;Alex;That one is quite good. It's one of my favorites.|{c:e;Alex;NoSmile}What caught your interest with this one in particular?
expression;Lucy;NoSmile
speak;Lucy;That book you lent me said that it's good for soothing a sore throat.|I was hoping it could ease my mother's symptoms, at least.
speak;Alex;Ah, I see. How about we make a batch together?|That way we can figure out a good way to prepare it before|having your mother give it a try.
speak;Lucy;Oh, good idea!

speak;Alex;Alright, looks like it's done. Let me pour you a cup, Lucy.|{c:e;Alex;Smile}Feel free to add some lemon and honey, but don't go overboard.
expression;Lucy;Smile
speak;Lucy;Thank you very much, Miss Alex. I think I'll try it as is first.

speak;Lucy;Oh, wow, I can see why this is recommended for sore throats.|You can really feel it go down with just a little sip.
speak;Alex;Yes, I agree.|That's why I prefer to have it with a squeeze of lemon and some honey.|Not only do their flavors compliment the ginger, they can also ease an ailing throat.
expression;Lucy;Smile
speak;Lucy;I'll give it a taste.

speak;Alex;You're very welcome, Lucy. Please let me know what she thinks of the tea.
speak;Lucy;Of course!

speak;Lucy;Miss Alex! Thanks again for helping with the tea.|Mom really liked it.
expression;Alex;Smile
speak;Alex;I'm glad to hear that, Lucy.
expression;Lucy;HalfCloseEyes,NoSmile
speak;Lucy;I just wish there was more I could do for her.
expression;Alex;NoSmile
speak;Alex;Well, there's only so much you can do.|{c:e;Alex;Smile}But I think what you have done has been helping a lot.
expression;Lucy;NormalBlink
speak;Lucy;You really think so?
speak;Alex;Absolutely.|If anything, I'm sure your mother is happy that her daughter cares so much for her.
speak;Lucy;Thank you, Miss Alex, but I still want to try harder for her.
expression;Alex;CloseEyes,NoSmile
speak;Alex;Hm{tgm}...{tgm}|{c:e;Alex;NormalBlink}I have an idea. Why don't I teach you how to grow your own ginger?|I've been reading up on how to grow various herbs and roots for tea.|Ginger does take a while to grow, but if we start now,|we'll be able to harvest it sometime next year.
expression;Lucy;Smile
speak;Lucy;That's a great idea!
expression;Alex;Smile
speak;Alex;Then, let's grab some ginger roots from the market.|We can plant them in the fields behind the castle when we come back.
speak;Lucy;Okay!
