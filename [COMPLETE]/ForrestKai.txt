speak;Forrest;Good spar today, Kai.
expression;Kai;Smile
speak;Kai;Sure was. That puts our monthly spars at a tie again with four wins each.
speak;Forrest;Seems so. Though we're evenly matched, your speed always impresses me.|It feels as if you can get another attack in before I can do anything.
speak;Kai;Thanks, but it's not like you make it any easier for me.|Your defensive maneuvers always keep me on my toes.
expression;Forrest;NoSmile
speak;Forrest;Perhaps one day we'll see who's the better one between us.
expression;Kai;Smile,CloseEyes
speak;Kai;I believe we already established that around eight months ago.
speak;Forrest;That was a fluke and you know it.
expression;Kai;NormalBlink,Smile
speak;Kai;Aw, don't be like that. Look at it this way.|If I didn't win, you would've lost out on the best sparring partner in the world.

speak;Kai;Come on. You like having me around. Admit it.
expression;Forrest;CloseEyes
speak;Forrest;Before this conversation, I would have agreed.|{c:e;Forrest;NormalBlink}But I suppose training alongside you has had its benefits.
expression;Kai;CloseEyes,Smile
speak;Kai;Now was that so hard?
expression;Forrest;CloseEyes
speak;Forrest;If I knew you were this insufferable, I would have never agreed to hiring you.|{c:e;Forrest;NormalBlink}Still, your knowledge has proved useful time and time again.|You have been a great addition to our ranks thus far.
expression;Kai;NormalBlink,Smile
speak;Kai;Happy to be of service.
speak;Forrest;At any rate, I will be preparing for our next spar.|{c:e;Forrest;Smile}Don't expect me to go easy on you.
expression;Kai;CloseEyes,Smile
speak;Kai;I never do, Forrest. I never do.

speak;Kai;Hey, I've been wondering something.|What reasons do you have for training as much as you do?|Aside from the obvious, of course.
speak;Forrest;I'm afraid the obvious reason is my only reason, Kai.|Protecting Her Highness is my duty, and I take this duty seriously.|I'd even lay down my life if it meant ensuring her safety.
speak;Kai;You sure have a one-track mind.|Is that why you were so dead-set on beating me during our first spar?
speak;Forrest;Perhaps.
speak;Kai;It checks out if that were the case. We did agree that if I won, I'd be hired, after all.|Were you so opposed to have anyone get close to Her Highness that|you'd do whatever it took to keep her out of reach?
speak;Forrest;!!;no_talk
expression;Kai;CloseEyes,Smile
speak;Kai;You're so easy to read.|{c:e;Kai;NormalBlink,Smile}With how much you wear your heart on your sleeve,|I'm surprised Her Highness hasn't figured out that you--

speak;Kai;In all seriousness, your devotion is almost enviable, Forrest.|Can't say I'm of the same mentality, though.|I value my own existence much more than anyone else's.|{c:e;Kai;CloseEyes}If I realized that sooner, then maybe things could've been different{tgm}...

speak;Kai;Granted, I've been suspicious of both you and Her Highness.|But now, let's just say you're off my list of possible suspects.

expression;Forrest;CloseEyes
speak;Forrest;{tgm}...{tgm} I see.
