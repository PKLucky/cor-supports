speak;Krista;Aqua! You startled me.
speak;Aqua;I'm sorry, did I interrupt your prayer?|If so, I deeply apologize.
speak;Krista;No worries. I was just{tgm}...{tgm} doing a daily prayer.|Nothing incredibly sacred or anything.
speak;Aqua;Nonsense! Any communication with your god should be treated with respect.|Please, finish your prayer in peace. We can talk later.
speak;Krista;Alright. Thanks, Aqua.|But really, you don't have anything to apologize for.

speak;Aqua;I still feel bad about it.|{c:e;Aqua;CloseEyes}Hm{tgm}...{tgm}|{c:e;Aqua;NormalBlink,Smile}Oh, I have an idea! Why don't we pray together from now on?|That way, I won't walk in on you praying again.

speak;Krista;Hm{tgm}...{tgm}|{c:e;Krista;NormalBlink}Well, I guess that's fine if you're alright with it.
speak;Aqua;Perfect! The next time you wish to pray, please let me know.

speak;Krista;I guess so. How do you suppose we go about this?|Being from Foliaga, you worship Folia, right?
speak;Aqua;Yes, that's right.|While I'm used to praying aloud with others when I was with the clergy,|I will be alright with us silently praying.

speak;Krista;Yup.|Hey, Aqua?
speak;Aqua;Yes?
speak;Krista;What kind of god is Folia like? Just curious.
expression;Aqua;CloseEyes,Smile
speak;Aqua;Ah, the Teal Wyrm Folia{tgm}...
expression;Aqua;NormalBlink,Smile
speak;Aqua;He's a benevolent god, providing bountiful harvests and the beauties of nature to|everyone in Foliaga.|He treats his followers with love and care, and never turns his back on them,|no matter the circumstance.
expression;Krista;CloseEyes
speak;Krista;I see{tgm}...
speak;Aqua;And what about Medea? What is he like?
expression;Krista;NormalBlink
speak;Krista;Hardy, all-knowing, and protective of Yondo as a whole.|He strives for peace amongst his children and provides guidance to his followers.|My family--the royal bloodline--are descendants of him, you know.|We're expected to follow in his footsteps.|Be not only a good leader to those in Medeas, but to all of Yondo as well.|{c:e;Krista;HalfCloseEyes}Considering everything, I wonder if I{tgm}...{tgm}|{c:e;Krista;NormalBlink}S-Sorry, Aqua, I started to ramble a bit there, huh?
expression;Aqua;NoSmile
speak;Aqua;No need to apologize, Your Highness.|It was interesting to learn about Medea,|especially when you have such a close connection to him.|{c:e;Aqua;Smile}And if you don't mind me saying,|I think you live up to be as good of a leader as Medea expects you to be.

speak;Aqua;Yes.{c:e;Aqua;Smile} I'm glad we can do this together, Your Highness.|Despite us worshipping different gods, I found this to be a pleasant experience.

speak;Krista;Honestly, I agree.|This wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.
expression;Aqua;NoSmile
speak;Aqua;What do you mean?
expression;Krista;NoSmile
speak;Krista;I wasn't completely honest with you the other day, Aqua.|When you walked in on me praying,|I wasn't reciting a traditional daily prayer.|{c:e;Krista;HalfCloseEyes}I was asking Medea for forgiveness.|{c:e;Krista;NormalBlink}I've been asking for forgiveness every day for the past year for{e:"{tgm}...{tgm} Ervan" if {v:TruthPlot} == True else " something{tgm}...{tgm}|I'm not really proud of"}.

speak;Krista;Like I said, don't worry about it.|{c:e;Krista;CloseEyes}Praying together like this, and when we talked about our gods{tgm}...{tgm}|{c:e;Krista;NormalBlink,Smile}It all really put me at ease, you know.
expression;Aqua;NormalBlink
speak;Aqua;Really?
expression;Krista;NoSmile
speak;Krista;Yeah. For the past year, I always wondered if Medea would ever forgive me.|If I was deserving of his forgiveness.|{c:e;Krista;CloseEyes}But then I thought about what you said. How Folia always puts his children first|and wants the best for them.|{c:e;Krista;NormalBlink,Smile}All the Great Beasts are siblings,|so I'm sure Folia's and Medea's kindness must have come from somewhere, right?
expression;Aqua;Smile
speak;Aqua;Absolutely.|And even if Medea doesn't find it in his heart to forgive you, I will.|{e:'You've done enough to prove you deserve forgiveness.|And even then, I'd still forgive you.|' if {v:TruthPlot} == True else ''}We're friends after all.
expression;Krista;Smile,CloseEyes
speak;Krista;Thanks, Aqua. I really appreciate that.
