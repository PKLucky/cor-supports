speak;Forrest;Taylor, about today's training--

speak;Taylor;General Forrest, I admire the work ethic,|but does it look like I wanna talk about our last session?
expression;Forrest;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Forrest;It looks like you're ready to drink yourself into a stupor.
expression;Taylor;NormalBlink,Smile
speak;Taylor;Glad we're on the same page.{c:e;Taylor;CloseEyes,Smile} Now, if you'll excuse me{tgm}...

speak;Forrest;Ah, hold on. Perhaps I should join you.|{c:e;Forrest;HalfCloseEyes}You may need{tgm}...{tgm} supervision.
expression;Taylor;NormalBlink,Smile
speak;Taylor;I'm a big boy, General, no need to worry!|But you can still tag along if you want. The more, the merrier!|{c:e;Taylor;NoSmile}By the way, have you actually drank alcohol before?
expression;Forrest;NormalBlink
speak;Forrest;No, never.
expression;Taylor;Smile
speak;Taylor;Not a problem! We'll start you off easy to figure out your tolerance.|{c:e;Taylor;NoSmile}I don't want you going out of commission tomorrow morning.|{c:e;Taylor;CloseEyes}Explaining to Her Highness why her most trusted knight is having|the worst hangover of his life is something I DON'T want to do.
speak;Forrest;I trust that you know what you're doing, Taylor.
expression;Taylor;NormalBlink,Smile
speak;Taylor;Of course I know what I'm doing!|Now, come on, let's head to the tavern! Drinks on me!

speak;Forrest;Taylor, what happened on the night we went to the tavern?
speak;Taylor;Oh. Uh. Why{tgm}...{tgm} do you ask{tgm}...?
expression;Forrest;NormalBlink
speak;Forrest;The women in town were giving me strange looks the last time I went out for errands.|{c:e;Forrest;HalfCloseEyes}I can only assume something{tgm}...{tgm} unsavory happened.|{c:e;Forrest;CloseEyes}I can hardly recall anything from that night, though. It's all a blur.
expression;Taylor;CloseEyes
speak;Taylor;It's probably best to let it stay a blur, buddy.|{c:e;Taylor;HalfCloseEyes}For your own peace of mind, I mean.
expression;Forrest;NormalBlink
speak;Forrest;Taylor, I fear my reputation is on the line here.|I need to know what happened.

speak;Taylor;Whoa, got another bouquet, General? That's the third one this week!
expression;Forrest;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Forrest;Taylor, that tavern outing was a horrible idea.|{c:e;Forrest;NormalBlink}The women in town won't leave me be.|{c:e;Forrest;CloseEyes}First, it was the barmaid, then the general store's shopkeeper, then the baker{tgm}...{tgm}|{c:e;Forrest;NormalBlink}And then it just kept going! I can't take it anymore, Taylor!
expression;Taylor;CloseEyes,Smile
speak;Taylor;You're way too stressed about this.|{c:e;Taylor;NormalBlink,Smile}Just look at how popular you're getting! You're gonna get a wife in no time.

speak;Taylor;Oh, I'm sure it ain't like that! You've got a lot going for you as is.|{c:e;Taylor;CloseEyes,Smile}You're handsome, loyal, and strong. Anyone would want a husband like that.|{c:e;Taylor;NormalBlink,Smile}And being a flirty drunk is just the cherry on top.
expression;Forrest;CloseEyes
speak;Forrest;Taylor.
speak;Taylor;But seriously though, this is really good for you!
expression;Forrest;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Forrest;How in Medea's name is this good?
expression;Taylor;NoSmile
speak;Taylor;Lemme put it into perspective for you.|You're so dedicated to training and serving the royal family.|{c:e;Taylor;Smile}Admirable? Sure!|{c:e;Taylor;NoSmile}But that also means you don't set aside time for yourself outside the castle.
expression;Forrest;NormalBlink
speak;Forrest;And{tgm}...?
speak;Taylor;You gotta let yourself live beyond your duties, General.|It's good for the soul!
speak;Forrest;What do you mean?
expression;Taylor;Smile
speak;Taylor;Let me ask you this. Wasn't that night at the tavern fun?
speak;Forrest;From what little I remember, it was.
speak;Taylor;Exactly! Expanding your world and experiencing new things does wonders!|And that can all start by meeting new people.
expression;Forrest;CloseEyes
speak;Forrest;Hm{tgm}...
expression;Taylor;NoSmile
speak;Taylor;I'm not saying you gotta drink 'til you pass out every night to do that.|It can be something small like striking up a conversation with the shopkeeper the|next time you do errands.|{c:e;Taylor;Smile}Or flirting back the next time you get a gift from one of the girls in town.
expression;Forrest;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Forrest;I am NOT doing that.
expression;Taylor;CloseEyes,Smile
speak;Taylor;Haha! Fair enough.
expression;Forrest;NormalBlink
speak;Forrest;I could try your first suggestion, though.
expression;Taylor;NormalBlink,Smile
speak;Taylor;That's what I like to hear!|{c:e;Taylor;NoSmile}Anyway, you've obviously had a long day. You know what you need?
