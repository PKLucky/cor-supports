speak;Alex;Ah, there you are, Taylor.|Training again, I see.
expression;Taylor;Smile
speak;Taylor;Alex, hey!|Need me for something?
speak;Alex;Yes, actually.|I have something I wish to discuss with you.
expression;Taylor;NoSmile
speak;Taylor;I'm all ears.
speak;Alex;It seems all you do is train.|Don't you have anything else you do during your free time?
expression;Taylor;Smile
speak;Taylor;Uh, I go to the tavern?
expression;Alex;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Alex;I am well aware of that.
speak;Taylor;Speaking of which, wanna grab a drink after I'm done with training for the day?|My treat!
speak;Alex;No. I do not want a repeat of last time.
speak;Taylor;Oh, come on!|I'll limit myself to three mugs of ale this time!
expression;Alex;CloseEyes
speak;Alex;Taylor--{c:e;Alex;NormalBlink}Never mind.|We're getting off topic.|You may be physically strong, but you need to be mentally strong too.|That's why I'll lend you this.
expression;Taylor;NoSmile
speak;Taylor;A book?
speak;Alex;Yes. Luckily for you, I picked something I think you'll enjoy: "The Trials of Sir Aaron".|{c:e;Alex;Smile}The battle scenes are quite exhilarating, and the main character is a noble, brave warrior.|Much like you, in a way.
expression;Taylor;CloseEyes,Smile
speak;Taylor;Heh. Flattery will get you nowhere, Alex.|{c:e;Taylor;NormalBlink,NoSmile}Still, I'll give this whole "reading" thing a go.|You obviously put a lot of thought into this.|I'd hate to disappoint my best friend.
speak;Alex;Thank you, Taylor.|Let me know what you think of it when you're done.

speak;Taylor;Hey, Alex, about that book you lent me{tgm}...
expression;Alex;Smile
speak;Alex;Oh, you finished it?|What did you think?
speak;Taylor;I'm gonna be blunt here: Terrible.
expression;Alex;NoSmile
speak;Alex;Really? Why do you say that?
speak;Taylor;You know that part when Aaron was going one-on-one against that general?|That was the worst display of swordsmanship I've ever seen!|{tgm}{c:expression;Taylor;HalfCloseEyes}...{tgm} Read.{br}Whatever.
speak;Alex;I thought it was a heart-racing moment.|His sword pierced right through his armor, and he took him down in one blow!
expression;Taylor;NormalBlink
speak;Taylor;Yeah, but piercing through PLATE? That stuff's thick!|There's no way Aaron's blade could've done that.|And stuff like that keeps happening over and over through the entire book!

speak;Alex;There's this thing called "suspension of disbelief", you know.
expression;Taylor;CloseEyes

expression;Alex;NormalBlink
speak;Alex;Thank you.|{c:e;Alex;CloseEyes}*sigh* I suppose I will have to re-think my approach{tgm}...

speak;Alex;Taylor, I seem to have misplaced one of my books.|It's called "Tryst by Moonlight". Have you seen it?
speak;Taylor;Oh yeah! You dropped it the other day.|Here you go.
expression;Alex;Smile
speak;Alex;What a relief! I thought I would never find it again.|Thank you, Taylor. This is one of my favorites.
expression;Taylor;Smile
speak;Taylor;I can see why. It's pretty good!
expression;Alex;NoSmile
speak;Alex;Wait, you read it?
speak;Taylor;And finished it!
speak;Alex;Is that so? What did you think of it?
expression;Taylor;NoSmile
speak;Taylor;The relationship between Percy and Lana is sweet, if a little tragic.|All that hardship, just for Percy to die at the end{tgm}...{tgm}|{c:e;Taylor;HalfCloseEyes}Poor Lana. Gotta admit, I teared up.
speak;Alex;Huh. Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it.|I would have never thought you'd be a romantic, Taylor.
expression;Taylor;NormalBlink
speak;Taylor;Me neither!|So, you got more stuff like that?
expression;Alex;Smile
speak;Alex;I do. Would you like something bittersweet again or something more lighthearted?
speak;Taylor;Something lighthearted this time.|I don't feel like crying over a book again. Maybe some other time.
speak;Alex;Haha! I'll see what I have, then.
