speak;Felicity;Joshua, what is the meaning of this?
speak;Joshua;Oh, these swords aren't mine. Well, except Old Iron here.|I offered to clean everyone's swords.
expression;Felicity;CloseEyes
speak;Felicity;That is NOT what I was referring to, Joshua.
speak;Joshua;What is the problem, then?
expression;Felicity;NormalBlink
speak;Felicity;Look around you!|Her Highness has been very gracious in granting you a private chamber,|and you let it get like this!|The state of this room is appalling!
speak;Joshua;What do you mean? There's no dust or rats or anything.
speak;Felicity;Oh sweet Medea! Where are your boots? Here on the nightstand?|Where's your armor? Hung up? No! It's thrown on the reading table.
speak;Joshua;You mean I can't temporarily put them there?
speak;Felicity;Of course not! Where did you grow up?|{c:e;Felicity;CloseEyes}Don't answer that. I don't want to know.
speak;Joshua;Soooo{tgm}...{tgm} you want armor and clothes in the closet instead?
expression;Felicity;NormalBlink
speak;Felicity;Yes, it would make my job easier.

speak;Felicity;Wait, isn't that Princess Krista's sword?
speak;Joshua;Yes, it's seen some heavy use.|I offered to sharpen it and clean it up. A few knicks in it too.|A little light for my liking, but it's a good blade. Well balanced.
speak;Felicity;You are something else.|Your room is worse than a rat's nest, but you keep your weapons and armor well-maintained.
speak;Joshua;If you don't maintain your weapons, they'll fail you when you need them most.
speak;Felicity;All of that is well and good,|but could you please maintain your chambers better?
expression;Joshua;Smile
speak;Joshua;Sure, I can do that.
expression;Felicity;Smile
speak;Felicity;Thank you!|{c:e;Felicity;HalfCloseEyes,Smile}Oh, next time you want to sneak out to the tavern,|I can get you out without Forrest knowing.{c:e;Felicity;NormalBlink,Smile} Bye!

speak;Felicity;Aha! I had a feeling my axe was with you.
speak;Joshua;Wait, you're saying this is yours?|I never expected you to know how to use martial weapons. Especially not axes.
expression;Felicity;NoSmile
speak;Felicity;Oh? And why not?
speak;Joshua;I figured you'd prefer to be on the sidelines.|Provide support from a distance with that magic-y stuff you do.
expression;Felicity;CloseEyes,Smile
speak;Felicity;You aren't wrong, per se.|{c:e;Felicity;NormalBlink,Smile}I do not put myself in the line of fire if I can help it.|But having a Plan B can be useful just in case something goes wrong.
speak;Joshua;Makes sense to me. Still, if you miss, it'll be costly.|Re-orienting yourself after a whiff takes time.
speak;Felicity;Oh, I'm well-aware. But you know I can be light on my feet.
speak;Joshua;Yeah, but you can't depend on that all the time.

speak;Joshua;Still pretty reckless.
