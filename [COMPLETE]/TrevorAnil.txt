Trevor: Anil, my friend! Could you spare me a moment of your time?
Anil: ?
Trevor: I shall take that as a "yes"!
Anil: *rolls eyes*
Trevor: You see, Her Highness assigned me to inform everyone of their duties in the upcoming days, and I would like to inform you--
Anil: *places hand over Trevor's mouth*
Trevor: Mm?!
Anil: ...
Trevor: Mph mm-mph mmm-mn??
Anil: *takes out a sheet of parchment and writes on it*
Trevor: Hm? What did you write? Let me take a look... "You talk too much. Goodbye."?
Anil: *nods*
(Anil leaves the scene.)
Trevor: Wait! Anil!
Trevor: You were assigned to do kitchen duty this week! Come back!!

Trevor: Anil, my friend, I have something I wish to ask of you.
Anil: ...
Trevor: I promise I will be quick about it.
Anil: ...
(Anil begins to leave.)
Trevor: Wait! Please! Stop!! Please hear me out, I beg of you! If you do not wish to fulfill my request, I promise you will not have to speak to me ever again.
Anil: *points to mouth and shakes head*
Trevor: Yes, yes, I know you cannot speak! Please take this seriously! As I alluded to before, this is my request: Could you please teach me sign language?
Anil: ! ... ?
Trevor: I assume you are wondering why I would ask this of you?
Anil: *nods*
Trevor: Well, the other day, you informed me that I spoke too much. So, I thought that if I learned how to sign, you would not have to hear me speak as often as before. Does this sound satisfactory to you?
Anil: ... *nods*
Trevor: Excellent! Thank you so much, Anil. I promise I will listen to your teachings to the best of my ability!
Anil: *points to mouth*
Trevor: Yes, yes, I know!!

Trevor: [Friend Anil! Good today you?]
Anil: [Good try. It's more like: "My friend, Anil. How are you today?"]
Trevor: I see! Hold on, let me try again. [My friend... Anil. How... are you... today??]
Anil: *nods* [Good job. You're a quick learner, Trevor.]
Trevor: [Thank you. You good teach.]
Anil: [Haha, almost got it. But I still understood what you meant. Oh, I've got a fun one to teach you. Look. @%!*]
Trevor: Oh? What does that mean?
Anil: [It's another way you can say "fu--]
Trevor: I will choose to not use that, thank you very much!!
Anil: [Why not? It can be useful sometimes.]
Trevor: I fail to see how that can be useful in any situation.
Anil: [Okay, okay. Here, I'll teach you an actual useful one. Watch. "I love you."]
Trevor: Anil, I swear if you're tricking me--
Anil: *shakes head*
Anil: *puts hand over heart*
Trevor: Hmmm. I assume that meant "I love you"?
Anil: *nods*
Trevor: Allow me to try. [I... love... you.]
Anil: [Good job. Go ahead and try again.]
Trevor: [I love you.]
Anil: [I love you too, Trevor.]
Trevor: Gah! Anil, please!!
Anil: [Sorry, Trevor. You're just easy to tease.]
Trevor: *sigh* Still, I appreciate you doing this for me, Anil. These lessons have been of the utmost help.
Anil: [Good. I'm glad I could help.]

Trevor: Anil!
Anil: [Trevor? What is it?]
Trevor: I have an urgent matter I wish to discuss with you.
Anil: [Am I on kitchen duty again?]
Trevor: I--Well, yes, you are, actually. But that is not the point! There are more urgent matters at hand.
Anil: [More important than kitchen duty?]
Trevor: Anil, please take this seriously. I am trying to tell you something important.
Anil: [Sorry, just poking fun at you. Go ahead, Trevor. I'm listening.]
Trevor: You see, I have perused the castle library some time ago and taught myself more sign language on my own.
Anil: [Oh, really? Let me see how much you've learned, then.]
Trevor: I apologize if I get something wrong, but here we go. [Anil, I... believe you are... smart... and patient... and a good... friend. I admire you... a lot. And that... is why I... will give you this.]
Anil: !!! [You're proposing to me?]
Trevor: *nods* [I want to... spend the rest... of my life... with you. Will you... take my hand... in marriage?]
Anil: *nod* *nod* *nod* [I love you. I love you. I love you!]
Trevor: [I love you too, Anil. I love you too so so much.]
