speak;Krista;Trevor! Just the man I wanted to see.
speak;Trevor;Is there something I could assist you with, Your Highness?
speak;Krista;Yup! I got a huge favor to ask.|It's something that's been on my mind for literal years.
expression;Trevor;Smile
speak;Trevor;Intriguing! Whatever could it be?
expression;Krista;NoSmile
speak;Krista;Could you teach me how to do magic?
expression;Trevor;NoSmile
speak;Trevor;I{tgm}...{tgm} suppose? It is not that simple, however.|Do you have any innate magical potential to begin with?
speak;Krista;See, that's the thing. My mother was a priestess from Foliaga.|So you'd think that would mean I could do magic myself.
speak;Trevor;I am assuming that is not the case?
expression;Krista;CloseEyes
speak;Krista;Not even close!|{c:e;Krista;NormalBlink}I can handle enchanted swords just fine, but that's as far as I can go.|{c:e;Krista;HalfCloseEyes,Smile}But{tgm}...
speak;Trevor;But?
expression;Krista;NormalBlink,NoSmile
speak;Krista;I wanna test a theory. I'm thinking maybe I'm just a late bloomer.|And here's where you come in with this little experiment.
speak;Trevor;I will guide you through the basics of magic and see if something happens?
expression;Krista;Smile
speak;Krista;Exactly! So, you in?
expression;Trevor;Smile
speak;Trevor;I don't see why not. This could prove to be an enlightening experience.
speak;Krista;Great! Just lemme know when you're free then we can get this rolling.

speak;Krista;Alright, you ready?
speak;Trevor;I believe so. I was thinking we should start with a simple fire spell.|Fire is the easiest element to control as well as the easiest to monitor.
expression;Krista;Smile
speak;Krista;Got it! So, just gotta read from a tome and do the thing?
expression;Trevor;CloseEyes,Smile
speak;Trevor;Oh, if only it were that simple.|{c:e;Trevor;NormalBlink,NoSmile}Remember what I said about innate magic ability?|That applies here.|A tome does nothing if there is no energy to work with.|Think of tomes as amplifiers of one's inner magic.
expression;Krista;CloseEyes,NoSmile
speak;Krista;An amplifier, huh{tgm}...?
speak;Trevor;Yes, Your Highness?
expression;Krista;NormalBlink
speak;Krista;Ah, nothing.|It's just that you reminded me of something an old friend of mine told me a long time ago.|She said something similar to that when explaining magic to me,|if not that exact thing word for word.
speak;Trevor;Oh{tgm}...?{tgm} Who was this friend of yours?
speak;Krista;House Valoria's daughter.|She was the one who was supposed to teach me magic in the first place.|Y'know, if magic was actually passed down to me.|It's their duty to teach the Medean royal family's heir magic stuff.
expression;Trevor;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Trevor;I{tgm}...{tgm} see{tgm}...
expression;Krista;NormalBlink
speak;Krista;I hope she's doing well. It's been so long since I last saw her.
expression;Trevor;NormalBlink
speak;Trevor;I{tgm}...{tgm} I'm sure she is, Your Highness.
speak;Krista;You doing okay, Trevor? You got quiet all of a sudden.
music;Silent Ground
speak;Trevor;Worry not. I am quite alright, Your Highness.|Although, I would like to ask something about House Valoria's heir.|If you do not mind, of course.
speak;Krista;Go for it.
speak;Trevor;At the time when she did try tutoring you in magic, what was she like?|What did you think of her?
expression;Krista;Smile,HalfCloseEyes
speak;Krista;What, got a crush on her or something?
bop_portrait;Trevor
speak;Trevor;Your Highness, please! I feel nothing of the sort!
expression;Krista;Smile,NormalBlink
speak;Krista;Haha! Sorry, just wanted to tease ya.|{c:e;Krista;NoSmile}But really, I liked her a lot. She was my best friend.|I didn't really have a lot of friends my age growing up.|{c:e;Krista;CloseEyes,Smile}Besides Prince Ervan and his brother, I mean.|{c:e;Krista;NormalBlink,NoSmile}When everyone noticed that magic wasn't a thing for me,|House Valoria stopped sending their daughter to the castle.|{c:e;Krista;CloseEyes}When Mother and Father told me she wouldn't be coming anymore, I couldn't stop crying.
speak;Trevor;Your Highness{tgm}...
expression;Krista;NormalBlink
speak;Krista;It's okay. I got over it eventually.
speak;Trevor;Do you still think of her?
speak;Krista;Yeah, I do.|Sometimes I wonder how much things would be different if magic came naturally to me.|{c:e;Krista;Smile}She'd probably be at my side along with Forrest and everyone else.

speak;Krista;Something on your mind, Trevor?

speak;Trevor;Ah, no. At any rate, shall we continue with the lesson?
expression;Krista;Smile
speak;Krista;Yeah! So, fire, huh?
expression;Trevor;Smile
speak;Trevor;Yes. Here is how we shall do this{tgm}...

expression;Krista;NormalBlink
speak;Krista;Trevor, it's okay. I think we should stop here.
speak;Trevor;Your Highness?
speak;Krista;I probably wasn't born with magical abilities, so I don't think this is gonna go anywhere.|{c:e;Krista;Smile}Thanks for trying this with me, though, Trevor.

speak;Krista;Huh? What are you talking about?
speak;Trevor;All my life, I could not meet anyone's expectations.|My family turned its back on me. My duty as the Valoria scion was unfulfilled.|Then fate chose to bring me back to you.
speak;Krista;Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down there!|Trevor, you can't be suggesting{tgm}...{tgm} Th-There's no way{tgm}...
expression;Trevor;CloseEyes
speak;Trevor;It is as you suspect.
speak;Krista;All this time, YOU were House Valoria's daughter?!
expression;Trevor;NormalBlink
speak;Trevor;I stripped myself of that identity the moment I left home six months ago.|I thought I was done with the past. And yet, it has come back to haunt me.|For a moment, I had the hope things would turn out differently.|That I could redeem myself of at least one failure.|{c:e;Trevor;CloseEyes}I was wrong. So, so wrong.
speak;Krista;Trevor{tgm}...
expression;Trevor;NormalBlink
speak;Trevor;I am a fool to think anything in my life would turn out right for me!|Does Medea just want me to suffer?|To torment me with reminders of my shortcomings?|This cursed past of mine... why can I not leave it all behind{tgm}...?{tgm}|{c:e;Trevor;CloseEyes}It is all so agonizing! Oh, Medea, what have I done to deserve this?!
speak;Krista;Trevor, stop that right now!

speak;Krista;Are you even hearing yourself? Saying all those things{tgm}...{tgm}|That's not the Trevor I know!
speak;Trevor;But--
expression;Krista;CloseEyes
speak;Krista;No "buts"!|{c:e;Krista;NormalBlink}Trevor, listen to me. You didn't fail me in the slightest.|Like I said before, I missed you and kept thinking about you.|{c:e;Krista;Smile}And here you are! You're back!|It's all I could have ever wanted.|{c:e;Krista;NoSmile}The only thing I wish was that I knew it was you sooner.
speak;Trevor;Krista{tgm}...{tgm} I{tgm}...{tgm} I am so sorry{tgm}...
speak;Krista;You don't have to apologize for anything.|It isn't your fault things didn't turn out the way people expected.|{c:e;Krista;CloseEyes}It's nobody's fault. Sometimes life is unfair like that.|{c:e;Krista;NormalBlink}Despite all that, you chose to shape your own future.|{c:ex;Krista;Smile}And I think that's amazing, Trevor. You're not a failure.|You never were.
expression;Trevor;CloseEyes
speak;Trevor;Even after all this time, you choose to be kind to me.|I do not deserve this. And yet{tgm}...{c:e;Trevor;NormalBlink}{tgm} I thank you.|{c:e;Trevor;Smile}If you believe in me, perhaps I can start believing in myself too.

expression;Trevor;CloseEyes
speak;Trevor;I did a lot of thinking, and I knew I had to tell you at some point.|{c:e;Trevor;HalfCloseEyes}I knew I couldn't back then. Nothing would've ever happened between us.|You were to be engaged to a Fuegan noble. That's how things were supposed to go.|{c:e;Trevor;CloseEyes}And even then, I was a girl. You had to produce an heir down the line.
speak;Krista;Trevor{tgm}...
