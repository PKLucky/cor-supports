expression;Kai;CloseEyes,Smile
speak;Kai;It's impolite to stare, you know.
expression;Yumi;HalfCloseEyes,Smile
speak;Yumi;My, aren't you sharp? It makes me wonder if you're used to getting stared at.

speak;Kai;Implying something?
expression;Yumi;NormalBlink,NoSmile
speak;Yumi;Does the nickname "The Escort Mercenary" mean anything to you?
expression;Kai;NoSmile
speak;Kai;Can't say it does. Should it?
speak;Yumi;I've heard that a handsome young mercenary from Merinas|has been selling more than just his sword arm.|{c:e;Yumi;HalfCloseEyes,Smile}If you catch my drift.|{c:e;Yumi;NormalBlink,NoSmile}Ring any bells?
expression;Kai;CloseEyes,Smile
speak;Kai;Well, I can admit my "swordplay" is decent.|{c:e;Kai;NormalBlink,Smile}And I have shown it off to those willing to pay me.|Though, I'd imagine not as often as these rumors say.
speak;Yumi;So, you're saying it HAS happened.
expression;Kai;CloseEyes,Smile
speak;Kai;Since you seem so interested in my services, let me lay out my terms.|{c:e;Kai;NormalBlink,NoSmile}Payment consists of both gold and information.|If the info's not good enough, it's a no-go.
expression;Yumi;Smile
speak;Yumi;Oh, it's good. Trust me. Working for the arena's got its perks.
expression;Kai;Smile
speak;Kai;In that case, how about we talk business over some drinks?|Let's see how good that info of yours really is.
expression;Yumi;HalfCloseEyes,Smile
speak;Yumi;Gladly.

speak;Kai;Aren't you persistent?|{c:e;Kai;NoSmile}Good job tailing me, but I'm still not gonna talk about that.
speak;Yumi;But--
speak;Kai;You gave me your payment and I delivered. Transaction's over.|I make it a policy to not dwell on nights like that after the fact.|It's best if you did the same, Yumi. I wouldn't want you to get attached.
speak;Yumi;Get attached? Just what kind of girl do you take me for?!
speak;Kai;I've seen this sort of thing happen before, Yumi.|{c:e;Kai;CloseEyes}We start talking more, you pay for more one-on-one time,|one thing leads to another--
speak;Yumi;Don't be so full of yourself! You weren't even that great.

speak;Kai;I{tgm}...{tgm} What?
expression;Yumi;CloseEyes
speak;Yumi;Oh, good. You're actually listening to me.|{c:e;Yumi;NormalBlink}Your performance was mediocre, Kai.
speak;Kai;Huh. That's a first.
speak;Yumi;It was such a drag! Where was the energy? The passion?|{c:e;Yumi;CloseEyes}Honestly, I feel bad for anyone who paid for such a poor display.
speak;Kai;Well, my past clients were satisfied enough, so why should I care?
expression;Yumi;NormalBlink
speak;Yumi;Do you even hear yourself right now?!|What about any future clients? You need to step it up for their sake.|Be glad I'm not asking for a refund.
expression;Kai;CloseEyes,Smile
speak;Kai;Wow, harsh words, Yumi. Harsh words.|{c:e;Kai;NormalBlink,NoSmile}But, again, the transaction's done. End of discussion.
speak;Yumi;Oh no, it's not. I am getting my money's worth out of you whether you like it or not.
speak;Kai;Your money's worth?|{c:e;Kai;CloseEyes}Oh, dear Merin, you're not suggesting{tgm}...

speak;Yumi;My quarters. I'll let you know when I'm free.

speak;KaiShirtless;And I keep telling you I don't care.|{c:e;KaiShirtless;NormalBlink}Whatever you're looking for, you're not gonna find it with me, Yumi.
expression;Yumi;NormalBlink
speak;Yumi;Why bother with this line of work then?
speak;KaiShirtless;Because there's a demand. It's all a means to an end.
speak;Yumi;Come on, you can't honestly believe that.|Hasn't there been at least one client who you maybe{tgm}...{tgm}|{c:e;Yumi;HalfCloseEyes}Wanted as more than just a client?
speak;KaiShirtless;Nope. It's just a job to me.
expression;Yumi;NormalBlink
speak;Yumi;Do you just not like doing it?
speak;KaiShirtless;I didn't say that. I just don't feel one way or another about it, is all.

expression;KaiShirtless;CloseEyes
speak;KaiShirtless;I know most people say they actually get excitement out of it, but not me.|{c:e;KaiShirtless;NormalBlink}Like I said before, as long as we both get what we want out of it,|I don't care how they feel.|At the end of the day, it's a transaction.
expression;Yumi;HalfCloseEyes,Smile
speak;Yumi;You know, if you said all that to begin with, I wouldn't have pestered you about it.
expression;KaiShirtless;CloseEyes,Smile
speak;KaiShirtless;It's what I was trying to say from the start.
expression;Yumi;CloseEyes,NoSmile
speak;Yumi;Hmm{tgm}...{tgm} I suppose so.|{c:e;Yumi;NormalBlink}Sorry for wasting your time, Kai.
expression;KaiShirtless;Smile
speak;KaiShirtless;Hey, that's my line.|{c:e;KaiShirtless;NoSmile}I'll refund you the gold, Yumi.|You said you'd want your money's worth, and you're not gonna get it.|So, it'd be in your best interest to take it back.
expression;Yumi;CloseEyes,Smile
speak;Yumi;Keep it.{c:e;Yumi;HalfCloseEyes,Smile} Think of it as compensation for me being a bother.
expression;KaiShirtless;CloseEyes,Smile
speak;KaiShirtless;Suit yourself.|{c:e;KaiShirtless;NormalBlink,NoSmile}Anyway, I'd better get dressed and out the door.|Better to slip out while it's still dark, after all.
