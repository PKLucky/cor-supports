speak;Krista;Maaaan. Do I gotta?|They're so boringgggg.
speak;Forrest;Yes, you "gotta".|As future queen of Medeas, you must be knowledgeable in many aspects.|Not just combat, but also history, mathematics--

speak;Krista;"And literature and theology to ensure a well-balanced mind, body, and spirit|befitting a proper ruler of Medeas."|{c:e;Krista;NormalBlink}Man, I've lost count of how many times I've heard that spiel.

speak;Krista;Wha--?|{c:e;Krista;CloseEyes}No way. I refuse to believe that!|{c:e;Krista;NormalBlink}You wouldn't throw away everything just to be with me.
