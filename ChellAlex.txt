Alex: Ah, Chell. I had a feeling you would be here.
Chell: Alex…

Alex: What are you going to do Chell?
Chell: About?
Alex: You know what I’m talking about, he’s been in the mountains, killing bandits, taking the law into his own hands. You’re a knight. It should have been the knights to route up those bandits.
Chell: I know
Alex What are you going
Chell: I don’t know!!!!........I don’t like that he left and he could have died so many times but…..
Alex: But?
Chell: Oh Medea forgive me. I’m GLAD he killed them Alex! Mother and father’s deaths were not unavenged! Their killers died! And I will not apologize for that.
Alex: Chell…..you can’t blame yourself, your anger is understandable but you need to forgive yourself. Let go of your guilt, someone had to step in and take care of your sisters. Who else was going to do it? You did the best you knew how to do. Lin will return one day, she is angry at her parents’ killers. You are a lot like your mother to your credit but it is why Lin left…..at least that’s what I suspect.
Chell: I need to return to the castle, there’s duties I need to attend to
Alex: Of course likewise
Chell: Alex?
Alex: Yes Chell?
Chell: Thank you. You’ve been my words of wisdom and a friend I could trust many times over the years.
