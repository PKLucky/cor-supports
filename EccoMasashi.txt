Ecco: So many cool things to buy, so little gold to spend. What's a girl to do?
Masashi, off-screen: Oh, what a dazzling ray of sunshine!
Ecco: What the hell? Can't a girl think without some idiot making comments?
(Masashi enters the scene.)
Masashi: Most fair of maidens, you have made this already beautiful day even more dazzling with your presence.
Ecco: Uh-huh. Look, buddy, I'm a little busy right now. There are plenty of other women around for you to "converse" with.
Masashi: Oh? What has consumed your attention so?
Ecco: I'm shopping. It's how I unwind.
Masashi: Shopping? As in PAYING for things?
Ecco: I'm not a thief, Maso.
Masashi: It's Masashi.
Ecco: Yeah, whatever, Mason. Anyway, I'm trying to decide what to buy.
Masashi: A goddess like you shouldn't have to spend money. Tell me what you want, my lovely lady, and I'll buy it for you. I can even help you carry your purchases.
Ecco: Oh? Why, thank you! It's so nice for a gentleman to offer to pay for me. Now, I need this dress, that platter of pastries, oh and that pearl necklace...
Masashi: Wait, slow down--
Ecco: I thought we could get some pie from the tea shop over there, some more shoes would be nice too...
Masashi, thinking: Oh Merin, my poor wallet!
Masashi: Why, of course! Certainly.
Masashi, thinking: Merin, Oreg, Medea, Fueg, Folia, please spare me!
