speak;Sam;Kai? How'd you know about that?

speak;Kai;Caught a bit of your interrogation earlier.|{c:e;Kai;NoSmile}I must say, your methods are{tgm}...{tgm}|{c:e;Kai;CloseEyes}Well, they lack refinement.|{c:e;Kai;NormalBlink}You had him in a chokehold. You could have broken his neck.
expression;Sam;CloseEyes
speak;Sam;Please. I know my own strength.|{c:e;Sam;NormalBlink}Would have needed more pressure than that to break it.
expression;Kai;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Kai;And you pulled his arm right out of the socket.
speak;Sam;Oh yeah, well, that's his problem for being such a weakling.
speak;Kai;Sam, where on earth did you learn such brutish interrogation tactics?
speak;Sam;Mercenary work. Used to be part of a mercenary company.|We did stuff like this all the time before assaulting their camp, fort, or whatnot.
expression;Kai;NormalBlink,Smile
speak;Kai;Fascinating.|You wouldn't happen to know of a mercenary called the Prowling Tiger, would you?
if;{v:SamKaiCh3} == True
speak;Sam;Nope, first I'm hearing of it.
expression;Kai;NoSmile
speak;Kai;I mentioned it when bandits were attacking your home.
speak;Sam;My house was being broken into!|You expect me to remember a pointless question like that?
speak;Kai;Honestly, yes, but that's neither here nor there.|So do you know of anyone like that?
end
speak;Sam;No, but I was part of this one group called the Ebony Tigers.|Maybe that Prowling Tiger is one of them?
expression;Kai;Smile
speak;Kai;Heh, maybe.
expression;Kai;CloseEyes,NoSmile
speak;Kai;He's not trained to be one, but his methods are effective as a ninja's,|even if not as refined.|{c:e;Kai;NormalBlink}He'd be a nightmare with actual training like that.;StyleNid=thought_bubble
expression;Kai;Smile
speak;Kai;Anyway, this was an enlightening conversation, Sam.|Talk to you later.
speak;Sam;Yeah, see ya.

Kai: Hey Sam
Sam: What up?
Kai: So you left Medea eight years ago?
Sam: More or less
Kai: Hmmmm……timing could be right but need more info You ever run into someone called the Prowling Tiger?
Sam: Prowling Tiger? Never heard of him. Who is he? Some bandit warlord?
Kai: Way I hear it, he’s a bit of a terror tale amongst the bandits, something they tell little bandits to scare them into obeying the higher ups.
Sam: Kai, bandits don’t need to make up tall tales to scare kids into obeying. A hard look and hefting your axe does that already
Kai: You’re no fun. Anyway, he lives within the mountains striking at bands of bandits and fortresses, leaving none alive. A real terror that one. Assuming he’s real, that is, and isn’t just a personification of happenstance. Such as maybe a wild animal attack, landslide, a flood or any other natural disaster.
Sam: Yeah that could be the case, but no I have not heard of anyone called the Prowling Tiger… Possibly one of my mercenary friends. Maybe it’s one of them, or they know someone who is called such.
Kai: Mercenary friends? 
Sam: When I left Medeas, a mercenary band took me in and taught me some things. It has helped me survive. One of them might be this Prowling Tiger or at very least one of them might know of someone who likely is.
Kai: Good to know. Who was this mercenary band? Just asking for a friend, you know. I have a friend who wants to get into the mercenary life and they might be a good starting place.
Sam: They were called the Ebony Tigers, if your friend has potential they may be willing to recruit him.
Kai: Good to know thanks!
(Kai leaves)
Kai, thinking: Well, I have some leads at least. Let’s get to work!)
