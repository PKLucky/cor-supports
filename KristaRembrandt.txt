speak;Rembrandt;You may come over, Your Highness.|I just finished.
move_portrait;Krista;Right
speak;Krista;Sorry about that.|I didn't realize you were performing the Fading Smoke ritual.
speak;Rembrandt;It's alright.
speak;Krista;Who were you paying respects to, if you don't mind me asking?
speak;Rembrandt;Old comrades.
speak;Krista;I see.
speak;Rembrandt;If you would like, you may pay your respects to Prince Ervan as well.

speak;Rembrandt;{tgm}...{tgm} Do you know the significance of this particular ritual, Your Highness?
expression;Krista;NormalBlink
speak;Krista;Hmm{tgm}...{tgm} vaguely.
speak;Rembrandt;Each aspect of the Fading Smoke ritual represents an individual's life and death.|The bonfire itself is one's life, burning with warmth.|And the smoke that rises reflects how fleeting life is.|It rises into the air and dissipates as if it were never there.
expression;Krista;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Krista;Never there{tgm}...
speak;Rembrandt;Though, there are signs that it had existed. Like the scent of wood smoke, for instance.|The bonfire itself also remains until it burns out.|Much like those who left us, there are still traces of them left behind.
expression;Krista;NormalBlink
speak;Krista;That's true.
speak;Rembrandt;Even so, everything has to end eventually.|Like the bonfire, it must die out.|Eventually, you must let go.

speak;Rembrandt;I will not tell you how to mourn over Prince Ervan's death, Your Highness.|However, you must remember you cannot hang onto him forever.

Krista: Quick question for you, Rembrandt. If you don't mind, of course.
Rembrandt: Go ahead, Your Highness.
Krista: What are Fuegan weddings like?
Rembrandt: Why would you like to know?
Krista: Just curious.
Rembrandt: It has been many years since I have attended a wedding, but I do remember some general things. They usually take place during the evening. Both the bride and groom are dressed in ceremonial garb, typically adorned with the crimson feathers of a Fuegan hawk. [Insert more details here]
Krista: Sounds nice.
Rembrandt: Quite. Although, I'm sure tradition states that you and His Highness would have followed Medean wedding customs when the time came.
Krista: O-Oh, uh. Yeah. Like I said, I was just curious. That's all.
