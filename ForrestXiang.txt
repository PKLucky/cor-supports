Xiang: His power... It's faint, but...
Forrest: Ah, Xiang. I did not see you there. Did you need something?
Xiang: Forrest, how apt would you say you are at casting magic?
Forrest: Hmm, not very. I've only dabbled in basic spellcasting. And it's not something I've ever considered putting a lot of focus into.
Xiang: Then, I would imagine that means you've never gone beyond exploring your options outside of the natural magicks?
Forrest: Ah, no.
Xiang: I see. Would you like to expand your knowledge?
Forrest: In what way exactly?
Xiang: Elder magic.
Forrest: Elder magic? You mean the dark arts?
Xiang: That's a rather derogatory way to refer to it. But, yes.
Forrest: Ah, I apologize. But either way, that's surprising. Why da--I mean, elder magic specifically? An innate talent for it is rare.
Xiang: You have the potential for it, Forrest. I can sense it.
Forrest: Are you sure you're not mistaken, Xiang?
Xiang: I'm positive. In fact, your potential for it has me curious about you. I wish to see how far you can go with this.
Forrest: Well, I have to admit, now I'm curious about that as well. I'll let you know when I have a moment to practice it with you, then.
