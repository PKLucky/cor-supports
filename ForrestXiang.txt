speak;Forrest;Ah, Xiang. I did not see you there. Did you need something?
speak;Xiang;Forrest, how apt would you say you are at casting magic?
expression;Forrest;CloseEyes
speak;Forrest;Hmm, not very.|{c:e;Forrest;NormalBlink}I've only dabbled in basic spellcasting.|And it's not something I've ever considered putting a lot of focus into.
speak;Xiang;Then, I would imagine that means you've never gone beyond|exploring your options outside of the natural magicks?
speak;Forrest;Ah, no.
speak;Xiang;I see. Would you like to expand your knowledge?
speak;Forrest;In what way exactly?
speak;Xiang;Elder magic.
speak;Forrest;Elder magic? You mean the dark arts?
expression;Xiang;CloseEyes
speak;Xiang;That's a rather derogatory way to refer to it.|{c:e;Xiang;NormalBlink}But, yes.
speak;Forrest;Ah, I apologize.|{c:e;Forrest;CloseEyes}But either way, that's surprising.|{c:e;Forrest;NormalBlink}Why da--I mean, elder magic specifically?|An innate talent for it is rare.
speak;Xiang;You have the potential for it, Forrest. I can sense it.
speak;Forrest;Are you sure you're not mistaken, Xiang?
speak;Xiang;I'm positive.|In fact, your potential for it has me curious about you.|I wish to see how far you can go with this.
expression;Forrest;CloseEyes
speak;Forrest;Well, I have to admit, now I'm curious about that as well.|{c:e;Forrest;NormalBlink}I'll let you know when I have a moment to practice it with you, then.
