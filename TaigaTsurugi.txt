Tsurugi: Miss Taiga, I think we're lost.
Taiga: Huh? What d'ya mean?
Tsurugi: I don't see the path back to camp.
Taiga: Aw, we don't need some dumb path! If I remember right, we were heading north of camp to get supplies. Then that just means we need to head south.
Tsurugi: But which way IS south?
Taiga: A great question. Look up at the sky. See that really bright star up there?
Tsurugi: Yes?
Taiga: I've been using that one as a guide since we headed out 'cause it's always pointing north. So we just gotta walk the opposite direction and we'll be back at camp in no time!
Tsurugi: Okay, I'm trusting you on this.
(One brief walk later...)
Taiga: And here we are!
Tsurugi: Wow, that worked!
Taiga: Of course it did! I ain't the navigator for the Wyrmfang Pirates for nothing.
Tsurugi: That was really useful to know, Miss Taiga. I would've been wandering that forest for ages if you weren't there.
Taiga: Y'know, that gives me an idea. I'll teach you more about the stars! That way, you can navigate on your own. You'll never know if I won't be around to help you out.
Tsurugi: That's a great idea! I'll take you up on that, Miss Taiga.
Taiga: Great! Just lemme know when you've got a free night, alright?
