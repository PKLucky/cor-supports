speak;Tsurugi;I don't see the path back to camp.
expression;Taiga;CloseEyes,Smile
speak;Taiga;Aw, we don't need some dumb path!|{c:e;Taiga;NormalBlink,Smile}If I remember right, we were heading north of camp to get supplies.|Then that just means we need to head south.
speak;Tsurugi;But which way IS south?
speak;Taiga;A great question. Look up at the sky.|See that really bright star up there?
speak;Tsurugi;Yes?
speak;Taiga;I've been using that one as a guide since we headed out 'cause it's always pointing north.|So we just gotta walk the opposite direction and we'll be back at camp in no time!
speak;Tsurugi;Okay, I'm trusting you on this.

speak;Tsurugi;Wow, that worked!
speak;Taiga;Of course it did! I ain't the navigator for the Wyrmfang Pirates for nothing.
expression;Tsurugi;NoSmile
speak;Tsurugi;That was really useful to know, Miss Taiga.|I would've been wandering that forest for ages if you weren't there.
expression;Taiga;NoSmile
speak;Taiga;Y'know, that gives me an idea. I'll teach you more about the stars!|That way, you can navigate on your own.|You'll never know if I won't be around to help you out.
expression;Tsurugi;Smile
speak;Tsurugi;That's a great idea! I'll take you up on that, Miss Taiga.
expression;Taiga;Smile
speak;Taiga;Great! Just lemme know when you've got a free night, alright?
