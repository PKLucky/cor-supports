Alex: How did I end up with all these books? I'm usually more responsible with my spending.
Ecco: Yoo-hoo! Alex! You out on a shopping spree too?
Alex: Huh? Who?
(Ecco enters the scene.)
Alex: Oh, Ecco. Hi. And, well, no. ... Yes? *sigh* I meant to only get one or two books, and next thing I know, I have a whole bookcase worth.
Ecco: Oh, is that all? We are going to be best friends. I can feel it. Anyway, you need to relax. There's nothing wrong with a little impromptu, impulsive shopping.
Alex: You call this "a little"?
Ecco: Eh, I wouldn't worry about it. Who's going to get hurt by it? By the way, there's this new pastry shop that opened. You have to try it. They have all kinds of sweets. And coffee too! Oh! And they have this new drink! A pumpkin spice latte! Mmm~ You gotta try it!
Alex: I've already spent so much. I really shouldn't.
Ecco: You gotta live a little, good grief! C'mon, it'll be fun.
Alex: Well, I suppose a little taste couldn't hurt.
Ecco: That's the spirit! And after this, let's go get some ice cream, and we can complain about stupid exes.
Alex: I haven't even dated to begin with.
Ecco: Irrelevant! Come on!
(Ecco leaves.)
Alex: Does she ever slow down?

Some time later
Alex: How on earth were you able to get all those merchants to reduce their prices by at least a quarter if not half or more?
Ecco: Bargaining. It's fun you should really try it more it can save you some serious coin
Alex: I can see that but how do you know how much to ask to reduce?
Ecco: I don't. You don't have to know what the going rate of say a pound of cheese is for example this kind of thing requires FEELING. You just offer a price that you FEEL is right
Alex: Feeling?
Ecco: Yup. Feeling
Alex: That feels...wrong it seems there should be thought and reason to it
Ecco: To complicated just go with what feels right, anyway it was a blast shopping with you Alex. Come find me next time you want to shop I got all sorts of bargaining tricks to show you
(Ecco leaves.)
