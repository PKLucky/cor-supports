Lucy: Mr Masashi?
Masashi: Ah, Lucy what can I do for you?
Lucy: You got a boo-boo in that last fight, I was goint to heal it for you before it festers or something
Masashi: Thank you Lucy but it’s nothing. Tis but a scratch
Lucy: Mamma always got mad whenever Pappa said that. Usually when he got hurt real bad, mamma wanted to heal him and he was being obstinate about it.
Masashi: I see, well I’m sure your mom and dad love each other very much
Lucy: Mr. Masashi why do guys lie to girls?
Masashi: Errrr…..I’m not sure I understand could you clarify what you mean?
Lucy: Why do guys say “It is ONLY a SLIGHT SCRATCH FAIR LADY WORRY NOT” or some ridiculous statement
Masashi: Well…hmmm…..that is a very good question Miss Lucy
