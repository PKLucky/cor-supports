Asuka “You. Where are you from and what business do you have in these parts?”
Matthew “Oh some place, not near here though”
Asuka “I know that. I wasn’t born yesterday wise guy. Any moron can see you aren’t from around here. What are you doing here?”
Matthew “Nothing much, just taking in the scenery, smelling the flowers you know.”
Asuka “I know the name of every infant born in Medea, Merinas, Oregot, Fuegsol and Foligae. I know every one of their family trees, so don’t play coy with me or do I look like a foo to you?”
Matthew “Of course not, you’re nothing like my young master. Still even he isn’t as dumb as he lets on.”
Asuka “Go on. Tell me more about this “young master” or this knife might find a new sheath beneath your ribs”
Matthew thinking (good grief this woman needs to lighten up)
