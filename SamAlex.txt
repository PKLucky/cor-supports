speak;Alex;Oh, hello Sam. I didn't know you liked the library too.
expression;Sam;Smile
speak;Sam;Hello, Alex.|Yes, I usually come here after training to unwind or|sometimes prior to settling down for the night.
speak;Alex;Mind if I join you?
speak;Sam;Not at all.
expression;Alex;NoSmile
speak;Alex;What's that you're reading?
expression;Sam;NoSmile
speak;Sam;A legend about the warrior Kull, the Crimson Lion.|He became bewitched and killed his entire village, family, everyone and|has to go across the lands performing deeds of atonement.|In the end, he dies, saving the life of a single shepherd.
speak;Alex;Did he manage to atone for his wrongs? He wasn't in his right mind.|He was under a spell, it sounds like, so it wasn't his fault.
speak;Sam;I like to think he did, but the legend seems to imply that he did not.|{c:e;Sam;CloseEyes}It ends with the words "Beware the folly of Kull or suffer his same fate".
speak;Alex;I see.|{c:e;Alex;Smile}I've been reading this one story,|"The Silver-Tongued Knight and the Silken-Haired Lady".
expression;Sam;NormalBlink
speak;Sam;What's it about?
expression;Alex;Smile,CloseEyes
speak;Alex;About love, promises made, some kept others broken.|{c:e;Alex;NoSmile,NormalBlink}The Silken-Haired Lady gets stolen from her home and|the Silver-Tongued Knight goes on a daring chase in pursuit of her captors.|{c:e;Alex;Smile}In the end, he rescues her, and the two share a kiss.
expression;Sam;Smile
speak;Sam;I see, interesting.|What other books do you like to read, Alex?
