speak;Cole;I have a question. What was the toughest magic duel you ever had?|I know that you're not supposed to just go into battle for the sake of it,|but I'm curious.

speak;Parker;Correct.
expression;Parker;NormalBlink,NoSmile
speak;Parker;In the end, I got desperate that I ended up just beating him with my fists.
expression;Cole;HalfCloseEyes

speak;Cole;Sorry for asking. I'm glad you're okay.
speak;Parker;It's not your fault. You're just curious.
expression;Cole;CloseEyes
speak;Cole;I need to be able to lift heavier tomes for the battles up ahead.
