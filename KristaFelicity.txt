Krista: Sorry I'm late, Felicity. I had way more stuff to do today than I thought. Anyway, ready to do the shopping together?
Felicity: No need, Your Highness. I had finished the shopping this morning on my own.
Krista: Oh! You've been doing that a lot lately, huh? Not that I mind, of course. It's good to see you getting more used to dealing with crowds.
Felicity: Actually, I arrived at the marketplace early enough when it was mostly quiet.
Krista: Oh, really? Still, thanks for all your help, Felicity. Just don't push yourself too hard, okay? I know that dealing with people can be tough sometimes.
Felicity: ...
Krista: Something wrong?
Felicity: It's... It's nothing. At any rate, I have more chores to attend to. If you'll excuse me...
(Felicity leaves the scene.)
Krista: I wonder what that was about.

Maid 1: Say, did you hear? Apparently some of Her Highness' garments had gone missing during the last laundry day. Guess who was on duty?
Maid 2: *Gasp!* No way! It was Felicity, wasn't it?
Maid 1: Mmhmm. Trisha told me all about it. Once a thief, always a thief, I tell you. Her Highness should just toss her back out to the streets where she belongs--
Krista, offscreen: Ahem.
Maid 1: Eep!
(Krista enters the scene.)
Maid 2: Y-Your Highness! Was there something you needed?
Krista: Oh, nothing in particular. But, Glenda, aren't you supposed to be scrubbing the floors in the west wing?
Maid 1: Um... I...
Krista: And Helen, aren't you supposed to be dusting in the main hall?
Maid 2: Well, that's--
Maid 1: O-Our apologies, Your Highness!
Maid 2: We'll be on our way now.
Krista: Before you leave, just one more thing.
Maid 1: Y-Yes?
Krista: Please remind the other maids that during THAT time of the month to treat the heavily soiled clothes properly and don't mix them in with the normal loads. Felicity has done SUCH a good job with that, so you don't need to tell her. In fact, let her know that I EXPLICITLY said she's been doing a great job around the castle overall.
Maid 2: ... Y-Yes, Your Highness. Now, if you'll please excuse us...
(Both maids leave the scene.)
Krista: *sigh* Some people... Hm... Felicity, you can come out now. I know you're around here somewhere.
(Felicity enters the scene.)
Felicity: You didn't need to do that, Your Highness.
Krista: How much did you hear?
Felicity: Enough to know their thoughts on me haven't changed at all.
Krista: Do the other maids always talk behind your back like this?
Felicity: It doesn't matter if they do or not. They can think whatever they want about me. I don't care.
Krista: You may not care, but I do. I'm gonna give them a proper talking to when I get the chance.
Felicity: I appreciate it, Your Highness, but it's best if you don't. It would only get worse if you interfered.
Krista: What do you mean?
Felicity: There is no need to worry about such things, Your Highness. Someone of your station has higher priorities than the well-being of one of their maids.
Krista: But--
Felicity: If you'll please excuse me, I have more chores to attend to.
(Felicity leaves.)
Krista: We're friends, Felicity. I can't just stand by like that.


Felicity: They'd twist the situation to make it look like I'm currying favor with you and further feed into their negative perceptions of me. Let them believe what they want to believe, Your Highness. You know me for who I am, and that's all that matters to me.
Krista: But still, it's rather cruel of them to hate you and not even try to get to know you.
Felicity: Some people will just hate you no matter what you do, Your Highness. And no amount of persuasion will change their mind. I learned that a long time ago.

Krista: Felicity, you knew all along? About Ervan, I mean.
Felicity: Yes, I did.
Krista: And all that time, you said nothing. But why?
Felicity: You always had others’ best interests at heart, Your Highness. I knew you wouldn't do any harm to him out of malice. But you always did let your emotions lead your actions.
Krista: Y-Yeah…
Felicity: I never thought less of you for what you did.
Krista: Really?
Felicity: However,

Felicity: When you offered your hand to me, I knew in that moment I would devote myself to you. You looked at me, and I didn't see Medea staring back. I saw YOU.
Krista: Felicity...
