Kai: I don’t want your apologies, Kenji! You said we’d always have each other’s backs. What happened to that, huh?!
Ryuuji: Kai…
Kai: You’re horrible! Abandoning me like that… You… You…!
Ryuuji: Ah, so that's how it is. Damn… I really messed up, huh?
Kai: Idiot. Just realizing things isn't going to change anything.
Ryuuji: Then give me a chance TO change.
Kai: !!
Ryuuji: I won't leave you. But if you wanna see that for yourself, you have to trust me.
Kai: …
Ryuuji: It's scary. I know it is. I left you once already, but I swear on my life it won't happen again. If I do, I'll let you strike me down yourself.
Kai: Kenji… Argh! Why would you say all of this to me now and not when I needed to hear it most?! I needed you five years ago, Kenji. I… I still need you.
Ryuuji: Then let me stay, Kai. Don't push me away.
Kai: Kenji…
Ryuuji: …
Kai: … Damn it…!
(Kai runs off.)
Ryuuji: *sigh*

Ryuuji: Kai.
Kai: …
Ryuuji: I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I've got something to say.
Kai: Yeah?
Ryuuji: I do love you too.
Kai: Wh- Don't say things you don't mean.
Ryuuji: But I do mean it. I love you, Kai.
Kai: Stop. Please, Kenji. I can't let myself think about you like that.
Ryuuji: What happened to you still needing me?
Kai: I was desperate, alright?! Being around you messes with my head. I can't think straight when you're around.
Ryuuji: Uh-huh?
Kai: Don't give me that look, you freaking know-it-all! Damn it, why are you like this?
Ryuuji: Because you always worm your way out of saying anything genuine. I won't allow it anymore. So, come on, Kai. Tell me how you really feel.
Kai: Y-You… …
Ryuuji: Well?
Kai: I'm not gonna say it!
Ryuuji: And why not?
Kai: I can't…!
