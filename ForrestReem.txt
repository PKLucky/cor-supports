Reem: Sir Forrest?
Forrest: Ah Lady Reem. Can I be of service?
Reem: We need to talk.
Forrest: Is something wrong? 
Reem: Yes something is wrong. You know exactly what’s wrong Forrest we need to discuss the bull in the china shop.
Forrest: I fail to see what could possibly be wrong Lady Reem
Reem: Forrest…….you have changed. A lot. You have always been a serious man but ever since Prince Ervan died you have thrown yourself full into your knightly duties and ONLY your knightly duties nothing else this isn’t good for you Forrest.
Forrest: A knight has no time or place for frivolities lady Reem
Reem: Then what of Sir Taylor and his…….habits? What of Lady Alex and her fondness of teas and reading? There are countless knights Forrest who are both a knight and still have interests outside being a knight. You have lost part of yourself, you used to study magic.
Forrest: Things have changed Lady Reem now if that is all?
Reem:.....sigh….for now yes Foreest (both leave)

Forrest: Nothing can ever happen between us, Reem. It has always been that way, and we both knew that.
Reem: But…
Forrest: This is even more true now. It goes beyond our respective duties. It’s…
Reem: Forrest…?
Forrest: I’m sorry. I truly am sorry, Reem. But I cannot say any more. For both our sakes.
