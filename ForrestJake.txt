speak;Jake;Well, sure thing, Sir Forrest! What's troubling ya?
expression;Forrest;CloseEyes
speak;Forrest;I{tgm}...{tgm} well{tgm}...{tgm} This is embarrassing, but{tgm}...{tgm}|{c:e;Forrest;NormalBlink}How do you{tgm}...{tgm}{br}court a woman?
expression;Jake;Smile
speak;Jake;Is that all? No need to be so shy about it!|So, who's the lucky lady?
speak;Forrest;Th-That is irrelevant, isn't it?
expression;Jake;NoSmile
speak;Jake;I mean, if I have an idea who the girl is, I could give ya better advice.
speak;Forrest;I would feel more comfortable if you gave me more general advice, then.
speak;Jake;If you say so.|{c:e;Jake;Smile}So, first thing's first. You gotta get on this girl's good side.|Listen to her problems, do little things for her, stuff like that.
speak;Forrest;I do a lot of that already.
speak;Jake;There we go! You're already ahead of the game here.|{c:e;Jake;NoSmile}From there, you drop subtle hints that you like her.|{c:e;Jake;CloseEyes}Key word here: SUBTLE.|{c:e;Jake;HalfCloseEyes}Speaking from personal experience.
speak;Forrest;But, it still worked, correct?{br}You and Anna--
expression;Jake;NormalBlink
speak;Jake;There were other girls before Anna.|{c:e;Jake;HalfCloseEyes}So many other girls{tgm}...
expression;Forrest;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Forrest;Ah.
expression;Jake;NormalBlink,Smile
speak;Jake;But yeah, subtlety is your best friend. Don't forget it!
expression;Forrest;NormalBlink
speak;Forrest;I apologize, Jake, but subtlety has not made any noticeable difference.
expression;Jake;NoSmile
speak;Jake;Huh, really? If that's the case, then might as well just be upfront with her!

speak;Forrest;N-No! That is not an option.
expression;Jake;CloseEyes
speak;Jake;Alright, alright. I think I see what the problem is.|{c:e;Jake;NormalBlink,Smile}Sir Forrest, what you need is to work on your confidence!
speak;Forrest;My confidence?
speak;Jake;Yup! Once we get that confidence up, you can get your girl, guaranteed!
speak;Forrest;I suppose we can try that.
speak;Jake;Great! I'm gonna brainstorm some ideas for confidence boosters.|I'll check back in with ya later.

Jake: Sir Forrest, there you are! I’ve got a whole bunch of ideas to get your confidence up to snuff. Are you free?
Forrest: Yes, I am.
Jake: Great! Let’s get started. To my room!
(Scene transitions to Jake’s room.)
Jake: Alright, first off, you gotta remember the most important thing: "With great confidence comes great won-fidence!"
Forrest: "Won-fidence."
Jake: Because you’ll always be a winner if you believe in yourself!
Forrest: Sure. Okay.
Jake: Now, as an accomplished warrior yourself, I'm sure you have a nice, strong stance and posture. So, just keep it up throughout the day, not just in battle. The way you carry yourself can get you into the right mindset.
Forrest: Hmm, I suppose that makes sense.
Jake: Once you're standing tall with your chest puffed out, then you gotta speak with conviction! No hesitation!
Forrest: Ah, well--
Jake: Aha! That's the problem! Sir Forrest, you have to make your intentions known. If you don’t speak up, your girl will never know how you feel.
Forrest: Jake, it's not that simple-
Jake: That's quitter talk! Here, I'll pretend to be the girl, then you seduce me.
Forrest: What--
Jake: Seduce me, Sir Forrest!
Forrest: Uh. Ahem.

A Support
Jake: Sir Forrest, I'm gonna be real frank with ya here. You never told me the girl you liked was the Medean princess herself!
Forrest: Does that change things?
Jake: Yes!! By a country mile! Man, if you've been followin' my advice to the letter this entire time, there's no way–
Forrest: I don't know what you're so worked up about. Your advice has helped, Jake. Much better than I expected, if I'm being honest.
Jake: Wh– I-I mean, yeah! Of course it has! Haha...
