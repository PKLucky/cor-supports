Chell: Marina, can you perform one of your dances for me? I'm getting winded, but one of your dances would probably invigorate me.
Marina: Of course, dear. And while my dances can motivate and re-energize people, don't overdo it. My dances cannot replace the need for sleep.
Chell: Of course. Hya! Ha! Hya! Ugha! *Pant, pant* Marina... Can you... do another dance?
Marina: Chell, while I admire how hard you work, you're overdoing it, darling. What is driving you so aggressively?
Chell: It's my sister... No, my mother. Well, both of them actually.
Marina: Sit down, dear. What is it?
Chell: You may have heard that my youngest sister Lin left she is...reluctant to talk to me. I already lost both of my parents Marian I don't want to lose my sister too especially when she's still living
Marina: Hmmm...Chell how old is Lin?
Chell: ....she would 16 by now
Marina: Ah...midteens, tragically lost her parents, I don't think you need to worry dear. Lin is most likely going through a rebellious stage probably fueled by the tragedy of her parents' death.
Chell: Why didn't I have such a time?
Marina: You're the oldest, typically the oldest look out for their younger siblings they more readily step up to the call when needed. The younger ones have the freedom to rebel there's also too maybe she wanted to forge her own way not to be living in her sisters' shadows. There are several possibilities but let her grow and come to herself and back to you dear
Chell: Thank you Marina, alright.
