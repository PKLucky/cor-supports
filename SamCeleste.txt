speak;Sam;Yeah, axes are really cool.|{c:e;Sam;Smile,NormalBlink}They're also fun to swing through the air.
speak;Celeste;I know, right?|{c:e;Celeste;Smile,CloseEyes}Whoosh, whoosh!{c:e;Celeste;Smile,NormalBlink} They're so cool!|{c:e;Celeste;NoSmile}I tried to get {e:'my friend' if game.get_unit('Michael').team != 'player' else ''} Michael to use an axe, but he just sticks to his lance.|{c:e;Celeste;CloseEyes}I never really got the appeal.

speak;Sam;I see.
speak;Celeste;Yeah. That's why I'm going to be the best axe swinger around one day!|They'll sing songs about Celeste the Invincible!{e:'|And her trusty sidekick Michael.' if game.check_alive('Michael') == True and game.get_unit('Michael').team == 'player' else ''}
