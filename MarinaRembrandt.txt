Marina: Why, hello, Mister Rembrandt. How are you on this beautiful day?
Rembrandt: Just fine, Miss Marina. Can I help you with something?
Marina: I've heard that you were injured during your time in the Fuegsol military.
Rembrandt: That is correct. Haven't been the same since. I can still swing a sword to ward off bandits and other assailants.
Marina: Have you heard of the practice of rehabilitation therapy? Such as if a circus tumbler takes a nasty fall, or if a dancer sprains her ankle while performing.
Rembrandt: I'm familiar with the concept, yes.
Marina: Did you undergo such treatment yourself, then?
Rembrandt: No. I was and am a mere soldier. Such therapy is for those of rank. Those worth spending such time on.
Marina: Every life is worth spending time on, Mister Rembrandt. And think of it this way. You could better serve in the army without that injury hindering you.
Rembrandt: That... That is an accurate assessment, Miss Marina. However, it has been a long time since that injury. I fear it may be too late now.
Marina: Nonsense. I can tell by how you move that it is not unsalvageable. You have a quickness and agility, but it's like you're moving through mire. You're slowed down and hindered. I could help you.
Rembrandt: How? Unless I'm mistaken, you are no physician, but a dancer.
Marina: Exactly. Dance with me, Mister Rembrandt.
Rembrandt: How would that help?
Marina: I've talked to many who study the use of the sword. They all tell me that it's a dance. Footwork is as vital as the sword swings and strokes.
Rembrandt: Hm...
Marina: While I am no practitioner of swordplay, I am a dancer. No one knows footwork better than a dancer.
Rembrandt: A very true statement.
Marina: So what I'm saying is that I can help you. Will you let me help you, Rembrandt?
Rembrandt: Yes, Miss Marina. I'll accept your help.
Marina: Good. Let's meet here again later, and we'll dance.
