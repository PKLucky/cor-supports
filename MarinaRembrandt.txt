Marina: Why, hello, Mister Rembrandt. How are you on this beautiful day?
Rembrandt: Just fine, Miss Marina. Can I help you with something?
Marina: How is your leg injury? Any signs of it improving?
Rembrandt: I'm afraid not. Some days, it's manageable. Others, not so much. Overall, I don't see it getting better any time soon.
Marina: Have you heard of rehabilitation therapy? If a circus tumbler takes a nasty fall or if a dancer sprains her ankle while performing, measures would be taken to ease them back into moving without pain or discomfort.
Rembrandt: I'm familiar with the concept, yes.
Marina: Did you undergo such treatment yourself, then?
Rembrandt: No. I was and am a mere soldier. Such therapy is for those of rank. Those worth spending such time on.
Marina: Every life is worth spending time on, Mister Rembrandt. And think of it this way. You could better serve in the army without that injury hindering you.
Rembrandt: Hm... That is an accurate assessment, Miss Marina. However, it has been a long time since that injury. I fear it may be too late now.
Marina: Nonsense. I can tell by how you move that it is not unsalvageable. You have a quickness and agility, but it's like you're moving through mire. I could help you.
Rembrandt: How? Unless I'm mistaken, you are no physician, but a dancer.
Marina: Exactly. Dance with me, Mister Rembrandt.
Rembrandt: Pardon?
Marina: I've talked to many who study the use of the sword. They all tell me that it's a dance. Footwork is as vital as the sword swings and strokes.
Rembrandt: Hm...
Marina: While I am no practitioner of swordplay, I am a dancer. No one knows footwork better than a dancer.
Rembrandt: A very true statement.
Marina: So, what do you say, Mister Rembrandt? Will you let me help you?
Rembrandt: Yes, Miss Marina. I'll accept your help.
Marina: Good, I'm glad. I'll come up with some simple dances we can do together, then we can meet back here.
