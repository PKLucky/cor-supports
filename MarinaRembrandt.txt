speak;Marina;Why, hello, Mister Rembrandt. How are you on this beautiful day?
speak;Rembrandt;Just fine, Miss Marina. Can I help you with something?
expression;Marina;NoSmile
speak;Marina;I've heard that you were injured during your time in the Fuegsol military.
speak;Rembrandt;That is correct.{c:e;Rembrandt;CloseEyes} Haven't been the same since.|{c:e;Rembrandt;NormalBlink}I can still swing a sword to ward off bandits and other assailants.
speak;Marina;Have you heard of the practice of rehabilitation therapy?|Such as if a circus tumbler takes a nasty fall,|or if a dancer sprains her ankle while performing.
speak;Rembrandt;I'm familiar with the concept, yes.
speak;Marina;Did you undergo such treatment yourself, then?
speak;Rembrandt;No. I was and am a mere soldier.|Such therapy is for those of rank. Those worth spending such time on.
speak;Marina;Every life is worth spending time on, Mister Rembrandt.|{c:e;Marina;Smile}And think of it this way.|You could better serve in the army without that injury hindering you.
speak;Rembrandt;That{tgm}...{tgm} That is an accurate assessment, Miss Marina.|However, it has been a long time since that injury.|{c:e;Rembrandt;CloseEyes}I fear it may be too late now.
speak;Marina;Nonsense. I can tell by how you move that it is not unsalvageable.|{c:e;Marina;NoSmile}You have a quickness and agility, but it's like you're moving through mire.|You're slowed down and hindered. I could help you.

speak;Rembrandt;How? Unless I'm mistaken, you are no physician, but a dancer.
speak;Marina;Exactly. Dance with me, Mister Rembrandt.
speak;Rembrandt;How would that help?
expression;Marina;Smile
speak;Marina;I've talked to many who study the use of the sword.|They all tell me that it's a dance.|Footwork is as vital as the sword swings and strokes.
expression;Rembrandt;CloseEyes
speak;Rembrandt;Hm{tgm}...
expression;Marina;NoSmile
speak;Marina;While I am no practitioner of swordplay, I am a dancer.|No one knows footwork better than a dancer.
expression;Rembrandt;NormalBlink
speak;Rembrandt;A very true statement.
speak;Marina;So what I'm saying is that I can help you.|Will you let me help you, Rembrandt?
expression;Rembrandt;Smile
speak;Rembrandt;Yes, Miss Marina. I'll accept your help.
expression;Marina;Smile
speak;Marina;Good. Let's meet here again later, and we'll dance.
