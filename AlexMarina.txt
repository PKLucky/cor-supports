Marina: Oh, hello, Alex. A reader yourself, I see. Mind if I join you?
Alex: Not at all. Actually, I do need someone to converse with. Please take a seat and let me pour you a cup of tea.
Marina: Why, thank you.
(Marina takes a seat.)
Marina: Now, what is on your mind?
Alex: Someday I would like to find my own white knight who could protect my honor.
Marina: There is something appealing about a dashing champion, isn't there? However, I'm afraid that while there are good men in the world, there isn't a Mr. Perfect.
Alex: Oh, I know that. Everyone's human. That's not quite the dilemma.
Marina: What is it then, dear? You look like something is troubling you.
Alex: It's... It's me. I worry that an eligible and reputable man would find me lacking. You, though, probably have many suitors.
Marina: While it is true that there are many who like the idea of being with me, it isn't Marina they want to be with. It's MARINA they want.
Alex: I don't understand.
Marina: They don't want me, Alex. They want the woman they see on the posters. They want the woman they see on the stage. They want THAT Marina. And, of course, there are those who just want their base desires met.
Alex: I didn't mean to complain.
Marina: I know, dear. I wasn't suggesting you were. I only meant that you don't have to worry about people falling over each other for an IDEA of you. They will want you for you.
Alex: Want me for me?
Marina: You may not have what some call "the perfect body", but you have your own appeal. There's something to be said about a moderate woman.
Alex: I never considered that.
Marina: You also don't need to worry about people liking you for your title, unlike Her Highness. I feel bad for her sometimes. I'm sure she has suitors crawling at her feet for her just because she's Medeas' princess. Reminds me of when I was younger when some only liked me for the fame I could bring them.
Alex: But still... How to phrase this... While I'm not looking for a Prince Charming, I'm looking for someone I can fall in love with. Someone to marry and look after. And he would look after me in return. However, I wonder if I would even catch someone's eye.
Marina: Alex. You have more going for you than you realize. While you are mature enough to understand there is no Prince Charming, you shouldn't worry about being the perfect girl either. There are still men who don't care about perfect. They just want a loving wife. Sadly, being a dancer makes finding such a man difficult for me. But they do exist.
Alex: I see. Thank you, Marina.
Marina: No, thank YOU, Alex. It was a lovely talk. And thank you for the tea.

[TO CUT?]
Marina: Oh, if you have any book recommendations, I would love to hear them. I just finished this. Next time we talk, you can share your recommendations.
Alex: Certainly.
Marina: Until next time, dear.
(Marina leaves the scene.)
Alex: I wonder what book this is? Hmm, "Heavenly Desires"? I haven't heard of this one before. Maybe it can give me an idea of what kinds of books she likes. ... Oh. ... Oh my. ... Oh, it went THERE already? I haven't even finished the first chapter yet.

B Support [MAY NEED REVISION/REWRITE]
Marina: Hello again, Alex. Not to put you in a rush, but have you finished "Heavenly Desires" yet? I've recently had this urge to give it another read. I'm also curious about any book recommendations you may have based on this.
Alex: Yes, here you go.
Marina: So, what did you think of it?
Alex: It was... a book. It WAS interesting, but does it really need all... THAT in it?
Marina: What do you-- Ohh... Hm... Probably not. Though, I still do enjoy it.
Alex: It was certainly more intense than anything I've read myself. And... the euphemisms. Oh, Medea, the euphemisms. Why call those parts of a woman "nether lips" and "nip nops"? Who talks like that?
Marina: No one to my knowledge, though I get a giggle out of it.
Alex: I don't mean to criticize it so much. It wasn't bad per se, but like I said, it progressed faster than what I'm used to. I haven't read anything of this intensity before.
Marina: I'll admit that book is intense and not something I would have recommended if you have not read something like this before.
Alex: Some of the intimate moments between the main couple were nice, but I do prefer a slower progression. Really let it brew and steep in first.
Marina: Ahhh, more into slow, methodical romances, I see. I can let you read another one of my favorites, if you'd like. There are a few I have that I think would be better for you.
Alex: I would not mind that at all.
(Scene transitions to Marina's room.)
Marina: Here we are, my personal book collection. One I would recommend to you is "Roses and Strawberry Wine". It's a more intense romance novel, but you're not diving into the deep end.
Alex: I'll give it a try. Thank you, Marina
Marina: Not at all, dear.
Alex: Oh, and since I'm borrowing a book of yours, why don't you take this?
Marina: "The Prince and the Peasant"?
Alex: Yes, it's a sweet romance about a noble who falls in love with a lowly farm girl. I like it a lot.
Marina: I'll give it a try. Thank you, Alex.
Alex: Of course. Until next time, Marina.
