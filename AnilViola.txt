[Viola asks Anil for help with (insert chore for the army here). Anil begins to write down his responses on paper, but Viola more or less understands what he's trying to convey despite him being unable to speak. Anil asks her about this, but Viola doesn't really know HOW she can intuit what he's saying, she can just tell. Despite this, Anil offers to teach her some basic sign language just so she doesn't have to just rely on her gut to understand what he's saying. Viola agrees to this.]

[Anil bumps into Viola and her Pegasus at the training grounds. Viola introduces her mount to Anil, but the Pegasus is wary around him because of his bow. Viola attempts to calm the Pegasus down, saying that they see Anil all the time on the battlefield and that "he only shoots down the bad guys." Anil is amused by the comment and also by the fact that Viola can perfectly communicate with her Pegasus. He points out her close relationship with her mount and wonders if there's something similar going on with how she's able to understand her pegasus and how she was able to understand him. Viola says she never really thought about it before, but thinks there might be some connection there. She decides to think about it more on her own later.]

A Support
[Viola meets up with Anil and reports back on her self-reflection. She comes to the conclusion that animals tend to be honest with their intentions and she sees Anil as a pretty honest person himself.]
