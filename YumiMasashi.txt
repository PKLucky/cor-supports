Yumi: The blade curves just right on this knife, but the hilt on this one’s way more sturdy. Hmm…
Masashi: Oh, what dazzling loveliness has assaulted my visage?
Yumi: And the perfect test subject for these beauties makes himself available. 
Masashi: What is your name, my maiden?
Yumi: It’s Yumi.
Masashi: Yumi, the tallest and most elegant and graceful of bows. And I, dear maiden, am an expert on all things archery, for I–
Yumi: Hold up, bucko! Did you just call me a “maiden”? As in a young girl?
Masashi: Er, yes? Have I offended you… lass?
Yumi: “Lass”!? Oh, we are WAY past the offending part, dog. Do I LOOK like a little girl to you? Do I?!
Masashi: W-Well you are of a youthful appearance. Wait, why did you just pick up that knife? It’s a dangerous item for one so–
Yumi: Come with me, you. We are having a lesson.
Masashi: Wah! (how did this happen? I just thought I could have a nice talk with an elegant-looking girl someone who looks like she will grow to be an esteemed young lady)

Masashi: Where are you taking me, lass? If I’ve offended you in some way I–
Yumi: Oh, we are WAY past offending me mister! Okay, this place is secluded enough. Do I seriously look like a young girl to you? Choose your next words carefully.
Masashi: Well, you are very attractive and of a most elegant poise.
Yumi: That is not the question. Do I look like a young girl to you?
Masashi: … Yes?
Yumi Okay, you asked for it. You have gone way too far now.
Masashi: what is she doing? Madam, stop! At least warn me before undressing. I’ll just give you some privacy–
Yumi: STOP! You stay right where you are and keep your eyes on me. I was hoping it wouldn’t come to this but for a blockhead like you, you are very dense.
Masashi: Oh Merin, she’s taking her entire dress off! Oh my, why is she so… heavy chested?? Why are they so round and bouncy?! Oh, this woman is so crass!
Yumi: Do THESE look like something a little girl would have?
Masashi: Uhhh… N-No, not at all!
Yumi: Does THIS look like something a child would have?
Masashi: N-No! Oh Merin, why is she so curve heavy? Why is her…….so round?
Yumi: I believe I’ve made my point. Now, I expect you to treat me with respect from here on out.
Masashi: Of course, m-my deepest apologies, madam. Any slight was unintended. I’ll just be going now. (Tries to run but Yumi grabs him)
Yumi: Now don’t you think that would be a shame and a waste of time? We’re alone in here. If I were to take your tunic off, we could have some fun~
Masashi: (Why is it always the crass ones?) Ah- Nnn… Why, that’s a very kind offer, madam.
Yumi: I’ll take that as a “yes”. Come closer, Masashi. (Turns him around as he tries to run again)
Masashi: O-of course, dear Yumi.
Yumi: Call me “Mistress Yumi.”
Masashi: Y-yes, Mistress Yumi.
Yumi: I could get used to this. Wonder what this oaf knows.

Masashi: I-I am- Sorry Mistress E- Yumi.
Yumi: Good, now on your knees.
Masashi: (Gets on knees represented by the flinch animation.) I-I understand Mistress Yumi.
Yumi: Good boy~. Now just a kiss or a few and we can have fun again.

Masashi: Yes Mistress Yumi.
