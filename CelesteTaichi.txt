Celeste: That last battle was really intense, but it was nothing I couldn't handle! Hup! Hiya! Shah!
Taichi: It's so dark... Whatever, not much different than what I'm used to, just more trees.
(Celeste throws the axe to a tree.)
Taichi: Woah! Be careful where you swing that!
Celeste: Sorry! Wasn't trying to hit you.
Taichi: Why are you practicing at night?
Celeste: I gotta be prepared for anything. A bad guy could come and attack during the night. It also allows my eyes to see better in the dark. Not just in the night, but caves too!
Taichi: Sorry to say, but it seems to not be working that well since you nearly hit me.
[THE FOLLOWING LINES NEED REVISION]
	Celeste: Well, I wasn't expecting to see you! And haven't done this enough.
	Taichi: Shh. Lower your voice. People are sleeping. Maybe you should do more night walking. I'll help, I've done night shopping.
	Celeste: Oh, sorry I should be more quiet, it is night after all. But I already have Night experience.
	Taichi: Is your Night experience sneaking out and running out for 20 minutes and getting caught by your mom?
	Celeste: Eh! (Smacks herself to keep herself quiet) How do you know?
	Taichi: That's what my brother did when he was… How old are you?
	Celeste: I'm 17 and looking at you, you don't seem that much older than me.
	Taichi: Oh, sorry he's 14 and noticeably shorter than you.

	Celeste: That's it! A week from now, outside some ruins, at noon. We'll duel. Do you accept?

Taichi: Sure.
Celeste: Awesome! See ya then! 
Taichi: Wait- 
(Celeste leaves)
Taichi, thinking: Well, it seems like I'm watching two kids now.

Celeste: So, you're here.
Taichi: We arrived at the same time.
Celeste: Have anything to say before we throw axes?
Taichi: I think we should probably delay this because we forgot to get wood for the army.
Celeste: Wait. Oh, darn! How could I have forgotten!
Taichi: Have you been focused on this battle all week?
Celeste: Well, I... Yes. I was super hyped for this and it mmmight have taken up a lot of my week?
Taichi: That's not good. We should probably get wood now.
Celeste: On it!
(They go to the forest.)
Celeste: ... And how about you, how much have you been thinking of this battle?
Taichi: Not much, really. I was taking care of stuff around camp.
(Celeste chops down a tree.)
Celeste: Then, how did you remember the duel?
[THE FOLLOWING LINES NEED REVISION]
	Taichi: I remembered it yesterday and was wondering how I should fight you.
	Celeste: (So what he's saying is? He hasn't been practicing, maybe we shouldn't duel today.) You don't have to worry about the duel today.

(Taichi chops down a tree.)
Taichi: Why not? You were excited about this all week.
Celeste: It doesn't seem fair. Plus, we don't have enough time to warm up.
Taichi: This is our warm up.
Celeste: No, we're both strong, but we still have more trees to chop down. And after that, we have to carry the wood back to base.
Taichi: Are you sure?
(Celeste chops down another tree.)
	Celeste: You're not a bad guy, and when in a friendly battle, we gotta play fair. [REVISE]
Taichi: Alright, I think that's enough wood. Let's get back to base.

Celeste: *Huff huff* Who won?
Taichi: *Huff* I don't know. *Huff* Let's just call it a draw for now.
Celeste: No way...! *Huff* We gotta decide a winner!
Taichi: We can do another round later. I'm exhausted. Aren't you?
Celeste: Hmm... Okay, fine.
Taichi: So, where did you learn how to use an axe?
Celeste: My mom taught me. She is-- Was-- Is! One of the Holy Knights of Foliaga. She's pretty cool and taught me a lot of other things too.
Taichi: What happened to your mom?
Celeste: I-I don't know. I haven't seen her since I fled from Florene Village. Did your mother also teach you how to use axes?
Taichi: Yeah. When I was five, both my parents started training me in axes. My mom was a famous warrior back in the day. Not just with axes but with swords too.
Celeste: Woah, that's cool! We both have cool moms!
Taichi: My dad was no slouch either. Like I said, he taught me axes too. He was a gladiator with a long win streak under his belt. He met my mom at the arena where they dueled each other. The match ended in a draw, and they got married some time after that.
Celeste: Wow. I don't even know who my dad is. My mom said he left before I was born and that he had green hair and green eyes. ... Hey, wait, you kept saying "was." Is your dad...?
Taichi: Yeah. A few years after Haruki was born, my dad started fighting in the arena again to bring back more money back home. Things were great. My mom was still teaching me axes and my dad told me and Haruki all about his victories in the arena. Then... ...
Celeste: Taichi...
Taichi: I remember that day when one of the militia men knocked on our door. . After that, my mom retired and started becoming more protective of us. I knew then I had to step up and take care of Haruki too. But that meant that I had to train myself more and more. Haruki was and probably feels like he's being cramped.
Celeste: Sounds a bit like my friends mom, he probably feels cramped because actually seen the version of your mom before your dad died so he probably not as timid as my friend.
Taichi: Do you ever wonder about your dad? Sorry for asking.
Celeste: Sometimes, maybe more now because I'm worried about my mom. But I don't really like him because he left my mom (please rewrite the last sentence into a way Celeste would say). 
Taichi: You seem less tired now.
Celeste: You're interesting.
Taichi: That has nothing to do with what I said.
Celeste: Could you tell me some haply stories with your parents?
Taichi: Well there was that time when I lifted up my mom's axe, I was two years old and I guess I thought her wielding it around was cool so I picked it up and she and dad started laughing, but eventually I lifted …
