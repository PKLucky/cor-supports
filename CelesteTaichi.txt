Celeste: That last battle was really intense, but it was nothing I couldn't handle! Hiht! Hiya! Ssshhhhah!
Taichi: It’s so dark… Whatever not much difference than what I'm used to, just too much trees.
(Celete throws the axe the to a tree)
Taichi: Woah! Be careful where you swing that!
Celeste: Sorry, wasn't trying to hit you.
Taichi: Why are you practicing at night?
Celeste: I got to be prepared for anything, a bad guy could come and attack during the night. It also allows my eyes to see better in the dark. Not just in the night, but caves too!
Taichi: Sorry to say but it seems to not be working that well since you nearly hit me.
Celeste: Well-! I wasn't expecting to see you! And haven't done this enough.
Taichi: Shh. Lower your voice. People are sleeping… Maybe you should do more night walking. I'll help, I've done night shopping.
Celeste: Oh, sorry I should be more quiet, it is night after all. But I already have Night experience.
Taichi: Is your Night experience sneaking out and running out for 20 minutes and getting caught by your mom?
Celeste: Eh! (Smacks herself to keep herself quiet) How do you know?
Taichi: That's what my brother did when he was… How old are you?
Celeste: I'm 17 and looking at you, you don't seem that much older than me.
Taichi: Oh, sorry he's 14 and noticeably shorter than you.
Celeste: That's it! A week from now, outside some ruins, at noon. We'll duel. Do you accept?
Taichi: Sure.
Celeste: See ya!
Taichi: Wai- 
(Celeste leaves)
Taichi: (Well, It seems like I'm watching two kids now.)

Celeste: So you're here.
Taichi: We arrived at the same time.
Celeste: Have anything to say before we throw axes?
Taichi: I think we should probably delay this because we forgot to get wood for the army.
Celeste: Wait. Oh darn! How could I have forgotten!
Taichi: Have you been focused on this battle all week?
Celeste: Well- I- Yes I was super hyped for this and it mmmight have taken up a lot of my week?
Taichi: That's not good. We should probably get wood now.
Celeste: On it!
(They go to the forest)
Celeste: -And how about you, how much have you been thinking of this battle?
Taichi: Not much really, I was taking care of stuff around camp.
Celeste: (chops down a tree) Then how did you remember the duel?
Taichi: I remember it yesterday and was wondering how I should fight you.
Celeste: (So what he's saying is? He hasn't been practicing, maybe we shouldn't duel today.) You don't have to worry about the duel today.
Taichi: (Chops another tree) Why not? You were excited about this all week?
Celeste: It doesn't seem fair, and plus we don't have enough time to warm up.
Taichi: This is our warm up.
Celeste: No, we're both strong but we still have more trees to chop down and after that we have to carry the wood back to base.
Taichi: Are you sure?
Celeste: (Chops tree) You're not a bad guy, and when in a friendly battle. We gotta play fair. 
Taichi: Alright, I think that's enough wood. Let's get back to base.

Celeste: (Breathing, please decide what noise to do for breathing) Who won?
Taichi: (Also breathing) I don't know. Where did you learn how to use an axe?
Celeste: My mom taught me, she is- w- is! one of the Holy Knight of Foliaga. She's pretty cool and also taught me a lot more thing too.
Taichi: Didn't she scold you for going out at night?
Celeste: I was 8, and it wasn't even that I was out at night. It was because I didn't ask.
Taichi: Where is your mom?
Celeste: I-I don't know? I haven't seen her since I fled from Florene Village.  (She tries to dodge this clearly uncomfortable question) Did your mother also teach you how to use axes?
Taichi: Yes, back before she had me and my brother she was a very well known warrior, not just with Axes but with Swords too. 
Celeste: Woah! That's cool we both have cool moms!
Taichi: Hold on, my dad was also no slouch either he was a Gladiator and had a very good victory count. Then he met my mom and then they had a duel. Couldn't decide who came out on top. They got married 6 months after that and 4 years after that they had me and for years after that they had my brother Haruki.
Celeste: I don't know who my dad is. I'll I know is that my mom said he left before I was born and that he had Green hair and Green Eyes. Please tell me more.
Taichi: When I was 5 both my parents started training me in Axes but two years later my dad went back to being a Gladiator, he was still there for us though but it was just my mom teaching me axes. Before my Twelfth Birthday… My dad was killed, one of the people he defeated from what I heard after that my mom retired and started becoming more protective of us. I knew then I had to step up and take care of Haruki too. But that meant that I had to train myself more and more. Haruki was and probably feels like he's being cramped.
Celeste: Sounds a bit like my friends mom, he probably feels cramped because actually seen the version of your mom before your dad died so he probably not as timid as my friend.
Taichi: Do you ever wonder about your dad? Sorry for asking.
Celeste: Sometimes, maybe more now because I'm worried about my mom. But I don't really like him because he left my mom (please rewrite the last sentence into a way Celeste would say). 
Taichi: You seem less tired now.
Celeste: You're interesting.
Taichi: That has nothing to do with what I said.
Celeste: Could you tell me some haply stories with your parents?
Taichi: Well there was that time when I lifted up my mom's axe, I was two years old and I guess I thought her wielding it around was cool so I picked it up and she and dad started laughing, but eventually I lifted …
