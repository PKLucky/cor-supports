Cole: Mister Sir Forrest Sir?
Forrest “What is it? Oh it’s you…Cole wasn’t it?
Cole “Sure is Mr Sir Forrest Sir
Forrest “You don’t need to call me Mr Sir Forrest, Just Sir Forrest is fine.
Cole “Ok Just Sir Forrest
Forrest …
Cole (grinning) Sorry Sir Forrest, bad joke. A book owner I was friends with would joke like that.
Forrest “You didn’t offend me or do anything wrong Cole, how can I help you
Cole “I was wondering if you would spar with me sometime Sir Forrest. A magic spar, Parker is a great teacher but I was hoping to broaden my experiences.
Forrest “A wise notion, I will warn you I am hardly fluent at spell casting, I mainly have the basics
Cole “Mr Parker says that just the basics will take one far and that without them you’re just showing off.
Forrest “Mr Parker sounds like a wise man, very well Cole I’ll spar with you and show you what I know just be aware that on the battlefield magic battles are…they can get very ugly don’t be too quick to throw yourself into battle if you’re not prepared for the possibility you may die
Cole”...y-yes sir. Will you still train me though?
Forrest “Yes I just hope what I can show and teach you is enough to keep you alive.
Cole ……(wow he cares a lot, despite how serious he is he cares a lot)
