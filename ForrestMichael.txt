Forrest: Excellent lance work, Michael. Very impressive.
Michael: Oh, Sir Forrest! Th-Thank you very much. How long were you standing there for?
Forrest: Not for too long. However, I can see that your technique is serviceable. This is due to your training with Foliaga's Holy Knights, I assume?
Michael: That's right.
Forrest: It's a huge decision to become a knight in the first place. What drove you to pursue this?
Michael: The stories, sir. Knights always helped and protected the needy and downtrodden. It made me want to do my part.
Forrest: Commendable. I had no such lofty aspirations, myself. I simply followed my father's footsteps. Although, Michael, I must ask. Are you prepared to die as a knight?
Michael: I'm sorry, sir, what?
Forrest: We are knights, Michael. We protect the realm and our liege with no hesitation. However, we are expendable.
Michael: ...
Forrest: So, I ask again. Are you willing to die in the name of your country, Michael?
Michael: I... I had not considered that, sir. In the stories, the knights never died. They slay dragons and rescue villagers with no trouble at all.
Forrest: This isn't a story Michael. Real life does not fall into such ideals.
Michael: I know, sir. It's just the prospect hadn't settled in. I guess with comrades and other knights, I thought I would be able to return home again.
Forrest: I advise that you put more thought into the decision you have made, Michael. You must be sure you are prepared for the road ahead.
