speak;Michael;Oh, Sir Forrest! Th-Thank you very much.|How long were you standing there for?
expression;Forrest;NoSmile
speak;Forrest;Not for too long. However, I can see that your technique is serviceable.|This is due to your training with Foliaga's Holy Knights, I assume?
speak;Michael;That's right.
speak;Forrest;It's a huge decision to become a knight in the first place.|What drove you to pursue this?
expression;Michael;Smile

expression;Forrest;Smile
speak;Forrest;Commendable. I had no such lofty aspirations, myself.|I simply followed my father's footsteps.|{c:e;Forrest;NoSmile}Although, Michael, I must ask.|Are you prepared to die as a knight?

speak;Michael;I{tgm}...{tgm} I had not considered that, sir.|{c:e;Michael;NormalBlink}In the stories, the knights never died.|They slay dragons and rescue villagers with no trouble at all.
speak;Forrest;This isn't a story Michael. Real life does not fall into such ideals.
speak;Michael;I know, sir. It's just the prospect hadn't settled in.|I guess with comrades and other knights,|I thought I would be able to return home again.
speak;Forrest;I advise that you put more thought into the decision you have made, Michael.|You must be sure you are prepared for the road ahead.
