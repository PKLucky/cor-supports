C Support:
Random soldiers practicing,
Celeste: Hyah! Hoo ya!
Taylor: Good job all of you! Keep honing those skills, the safety of Merinas lies with us. WE are the first and only defense of Merinas if we fail to defend her
Celeste: Captain Taylor sir? Doesn't Merinas have a Pegasus squad too?
Taylor: EXCELLENT QUESTION, and one which I will immediately ignore as it is irrelevant, AS I was saying we are-
Celeste: Also isn't there a troop of archers?
Taylor: Another good question, you got a good head kid but I'm beat my head can barely think after all that training
Two soldiers: He can barely think even when he hasn't been training all day
Soldier Two: Heh, heh, still he's the best captain I've ever served under
Taylor: I HEARD THAT! As punishment you two will be getting drinks for everyone and speaking of drinks to the tavern everybody! That includes you too Celeste
Celeste: Huh? Me? But I'm only-
Taylor: Yes you too, unimportant! 
Scene change:

Taylor, soldiers and Celeste "Now everybody's died, so untill our tears are dried, we'll drink and drink and drink and drink and then we'll drink some more!"
Taylor: Bartender! 'Nother round!
Taylor: Hey, Celeste you're a great drinker! I've never known another woman to drink like you can.
Celeste: Hee-hee. Aren't I a little young for you Taylor? Although...you are rather handsome
Taylor: ...Why does this happen every time I take a girl out drinking?
