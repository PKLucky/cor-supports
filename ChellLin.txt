Chell: Lin, you look well. I’m happy to see that such is the case.
Lin: … Sister, I’m not coming back home. When this is over, I’m returning to my mercenary work so don’t try to convince me to return……to the house.
Chell: I wasn’t going to. I’m just happy you’re well. How is the mercenary life?
Lin: Fine. It’s fine. Stop acting like you’re interested. You’re not. You just want me to return home. I already told you that is not happening.
Chell: Lin, if being a mercenary is what you want, I’m not going to stop you. I’m just happy to see you well. And safe.
Lin: See? You want me to return, I’m not going to. I’m going to check on my pegasus.

Chell: Father, mother… I just wanted her to know that I was happy to see her and to see she was doing well in the life she has chosen. Did I say something wrong? Oh Medea, help me. I just want my sister to know I love her and want her happy and that she’ll always have sisters who love her and a home waiting if she wants it.
Lin: By Medea’s fat ass! Does she HAVE to act like Mother? Always so patient! Must she make me think of Mother every time she talks? Does she want me to mourn Mother’s death again??? Why can’t she be… not like mother?
