speak;Forrest;Torgen, do you have a moment?
speak;Torgen;Yeah, what's up?
speak;Forrest;I never had the opportunity to ask about this until now, but{tgm}...
expression;Forrest;CloseEyes
speak;Forrest;Hm{tgm}...
speak;Torgen;Uh-huh? Come on, spit it out.
expression;Forrest;NormalBlink
speak;Forrest;About Princess Krista, why{tgm}...
expression;Forrest;CloseEyes
speak;Forrest;Or rather{tgm}...{tgm} How do I phrase this{tgm}...?
speak;Torgen;You wanna know why getting tied up turns her on.
expression;Forrest;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Forrest;I would have preferred a more subtle way of saying that, but yes.
speak;Torgen;See, I'm not one-hundred percent sure why she does, but I do have my theories.
expression;Forrest;NormalBlink
speak;Forrest;Go on.
speak;Torgen;Could be just that she likes it, no two ways about it.
expression;Torgen;CloseEyes,Smile
speak;Torgen;Who knows?|Maybe getting kidnapped all those years ago made her discover something about herself.
expression;Forrest;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Forrest;Please take this seriously, Torgen.
expression;Torgen;NormalBlink,NoSmile
speak;Torgen;I am! Not saying it could be the only reason.|There's also the chance the experience had the complete opposite effect.|She might've been traumatized so bad that this is her way of coping.
expression;Forrest;CloseEyes
speak;Forrest;That is disturbing and I hope that is not the case.
speak;Torgen;Hey, like I said, I'm just theorizing.|Why don't you just ask her yourself if you're so curious?
expression;Forrest;NormalBlink
speak;Forrest;I'd rather not. It's a{tgm}...{tgm} strange subject to talk about.
speak;Torgen;Figures.
expression;Torgen;CloseEyes
speak;Torgen;Hm{tgm}...
expression;Torgen;NormalBlink
speak;Torgen;Hey, I think I have an idea.
speak;Forrest;Yes?
speak;Torgen;Why don't I try tying YOU up?
expression;Forrest;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Forrest;What.
speak;Torgen;I'm just thinking that maybe you'll understand her point of view once you|get a feel for yourself.
expression;Forrest;NormalBlink
speak;Forrest;An{tgm}...{tgm} interesting proposition. I'll consider it.
expression;Torgen;CloseEyes,Smile
speak;Torgen;It's not a "no," at least.
expression;Torgen;NormalBlink,NoSmile
speak;Torgen;I'll give you time to think about it. Lemme know if you're down to do this.

speak;Forrest;I can't believe I agreed to this.
speak;Torgen;We can still call it quits before we even start.
expression;Forrest;NormalBlink
speak;Forrest;No. I need to know why Her Highness finds this so appealing.
speak;Torgen;Alright then. Take off your armor.
speak;Forrest;P-Pardon?
expression;Torgen;HalfCloseEyes,Smile
speak;Torgen;What, do you WANT to have all that on when you're restrained?

speak;Forrest;Am I supposed to?
speak;Torgen;Well, Krista usually gets all--
expression;Forrest;CloseEyes
speak;Forrest;Don't finish that sentence.
expression;Forrest;NormalBlink
speak;Forrest;But I still wish to deepen my understanding.|Restrain me more. Maybe only tying the upper body isn't enough for me.
speak;Torgen;Whatever you say.|Here, let's sit you down in that chair there. I'll tie your legs together.

speak;Torgen;Hmm{tgm}...
expression;Torgen;NormalBlink
speak;Torgen;Well, there's one last thing I could do,|but I'm gonna need your permission for it.
expression;Forrest;NormalBlink
speak;Forrest;What is it?
speak;Torgen;I'll blindfold you and touch different parts of your body without warning.|I won't go for anything between the legs even if you agree to this.|I'll guarantee that.
expression;Torgen;CloseEyes,Smile
speak;Torgen;I mean, unless you want me to.
expression;Forrest;CloseEyes
speak;Forrest;I don't.
expression;Forrest;NormalBlink
speak;Forrest;That aside, what would be the point of this?
expression;Torgen;NormalBlink,NoSmile
speak;Torgen;Taking away one of your senses will make you feel all helpless.|Maybe that's what Krista really likes about this.
expression;Forrest;CloseEyes
speak;Forrest;That{tgm}...{tgm} makes no sense.
expression;Forrest;NormalBlink
speak;Forrest;But I'm willing to try anything now. You may blindfold me, Torgen.

speak;Torgen;Now, I'd usually gag Krista at this point too,|but that defeats the purpose of getting feedback from you.|So, just lemme know if you notice anything, alright?
speak;Forrest;Of course.

speak;Forrest;(He's not doing anything. He wouldn't just leave me like this, would he?)|(No, of course not. But what if--)
speak;Forrest;!!
speak;Torgen;You were starting to squirm a bit.
speak;Forrest;Wh-Wha--
speak;Torgen;I think we're starting to get somewhere, though.
speak;Forrest;I hope so.
speak;Forrest;(Okay. Focus.)|(There has to be a reason why Krista likes this.)|(If I can understand that, then maybe--)
speak;Forrest;A-Ah...!?
speak;Torgen;Well, that sure was a noise.
speak;Forrest;I-I...
speak;Forrest;(My voice just came out on its own!)|(It was such an indecent sound too.)|(What... What is coming over me?)
speak;Forrest;Mnngh...!
speak;Torgen;Forrest?
