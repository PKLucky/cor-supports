??? Hey you! Over here.
Joshua: Huh? Oh hey there. Your names Ecco right?
Ecco: Sure is now here’s the thing I’m a mercenary
Joshua: Cool. So was my dad, I sometimes do it myself time to time
Ecco: Thing is sometimes there just aren’t any contracts around to take up and I need money
Joshua: I’m not in the habit of loaning money and both my father and my mother warned me about women asking for hand outs especially money hand outs
Ecco: Not what I’m asking for, what kind of girl do you take me for? A mere gold chaser?
Joshua: Not necessarily
Ecco: I hear you’re an arena fighter
Joshua: Yeah I got the idea from my dad, he would supplement arena fights with his mercenary work
Ecco: Huh. Smart, anyway I was wondering if you could get me in. I need a recommendation
Joshua: I don’t know about this, arena fights can be rough you never know who you’ll be up against. An armored opponent or maybe against a shaman you would be fine but you don’t want to bet on those odds
Ecco: Please. I can handle myself I’m a big girl
Joshua: Really? You look small and slender to me
Ecco: Tell you what. We spar and if I win you need to get me into the arena.
Joshua: Sure, let’s go.
