Yukino: (She must be a ninja, must be careful then.)
Asuka: (Dodges attack) Wait.
Yukino: Huh?
Asuka: Aren't you a part of Lady Krista's army?
Yukino: So you are too? Sorry I wasn't sure if you were a spy.
Asuka: I still am it's just that Emperor Samegoro is…
Yukino: I see, considering that we'll be working with each for the Foreseeable Future. I already know your title so tell me your name.
Asuka: I am Asuka.
Yukino: (Considering that she's a ninja for the Emperor I don't think saying I'm a bandit would be the best thing.) I am Yukino of- of Shizukawa village.
Asuka: Alright, why have you come to see me?
Yukino: I want to learn the way of the ninja. Please teach me.
Asuka: … Okay. Come back here another day and we'll start. (Asuka leaves)
Yukino:(Yes! I've always wanted to be a Ninja. That stopped when I married him.)

Yukino:So ninjas train with weights?
Asuka:It helps with stealth, so that way we're even faster.
Yukino:That's awe- I have taken intense sword training but we never used weights.
Asuka: (Moving around Yukino) The consequences for dropping them are disastrous, but considering your sword training I think you can handle it. But you should still be careful.
(Asuka ties Yukino to a chair)
Asuka:And always be on guard!
Yukino:Ergh! Fuck-
Asuka:I'll do this again on another day. Anyway, The weights we usually start off with are 10 weight- 
Yukino:Is this something that's usually done during training?
Asuka: ... But considering you're actually escaping the ropes we'll double it. Eventually we'll do Isometrics.
Yukino: How tight are these ropes?
Asuka:Very tight. Made with only the best material.
Yukino:Could you let me go?
Asuka:Got it.
(Asuka unties Yukino)
Yukino:There are four twenty weights here, how many weights do Ninja use?
Asuka:Four exactly, one tied up to each limb. Let's start.

Asuka: Hmm.
(Yukino sneaks up on Asuka)
Asuka: Good, getting better. I admire your way with your sword.
Yukino: Oh, I started sword practice when I was eight. I had stopped when I… got married but I got… back into it when… (I can't say I killed him, I'll be arrested.) We divorced. How did you become a Ninja?
Asuka: I think I can tell you now, I started training when I was nine, ten's the average age. I was trained by my mother and Yuuto- he's Kai's- The father of Princess Krista's retainer. As a ninja you are also taught discipline as soon as you start and will continue learning it.
Yukino: Ah, if only I knew that when I was ten. My parents said they didn't know when but I had a feeling that they were lying…  they did teach me swords, they were nice… most of time. Unfortunately they died when I was seventeen and then after that my grandfather introduced me to my ex-husband. I immediately found out how awful he was once our parents left us alone. But enough about that, how about your mom?
Asuka: The only fond memories I had of her are when she wasn't in ninja garb. Once she had it on she became cold, it comes with being a ninja but- because of that I ended up getting really attached to Yuuto, I was jealous of his wife to be honest.
Yukino: He didn't lead you on, did he?
Asuka: No! I just really liked being with him.
(While Asuka says this she lands a hit on Yukino)
Asuka: Remember, always keep your-
Yukino: -Eyes open, got it. The weight training feels good, I feel like I could cut that tree.
Asuka: That's it for today. See you next week.

Yukino: Hya!
Asuka: Gotcha!
(They jump away from each other. Asuka then hits Yukino)
Yukino: Ngh! How was I?
Asuka: You've gotten better, you can definitely become a ninja.
Yukino(smiles): Thank you~ I'll have to think if I'll be able to though. I have to continue to pr- I'd like to protect the woman of Shizukawa village. There's one thing I forgot to ask. When will we do more (Ties up Asuka) isometrics?
Asuka: Darn, I should have paid more attention. 
Yukino: I would like to know when we can continue isometrics please~?
Asuka: To- Nex- half a week from now.
Yukino: Alright. (Unties Asuka)
(Asuka kisses Yukino)
Asuka: I think you don't need Isometrics, you're already doing pretty well.
Yukino: Then how about going to the pond?
Asuka: Okay, but what else is there to teach you?
Yukino: You kissed me, how about a date? 
(Yukino gives Asuka a wooden sword)
Yukino: Sorry it isn't much but, If you need or want anything I'll look around.
Asuka: Hmm-
Yukino: Or would Shizukawa Village sound nice?
Asuka: I think you should decide that.
Yukino: Then let's go to…
