Viola: Felicity! I’ve figured it out!
Felicity: Figured out what, exactly?
Viola: Your age! I now know why my calculations were off.
Felicity: Oh?
Viola: I’ve been going about it all wrong. You’re just older than you look!
Felicity: Uh-
Viola: That’s totally it, right? You’re probably like forty or fifty and just look really young for your age!
Felicity: Oh! Um, yes. You got it right, Viola! Haha…
Viola: No need to be embarrassed about it! My mother was like that too.
