Viola: Hey, Felicity, mind clearing up something for me?
Felicity: What is it?
Viola: I'm trying to do the math in my head, and well... Her Highness hired you seven years ago, right?
Felicity: Correct.
Viola: And you're how old again?
Felicity: Oh, Viola, don't you know it's rude to ask a lady her age? Besides, I stopped keeping track a long time ago.
Viola: Hm... Well, you look like you're around my age, so that would mean you would've still been a teenager when you met Princess Krista. But that's not right! You look just like you did seven years ago.
Felicity: You can say I aged quite gracefully, then.
Viola: Wait, then... Hm... Hmmmmm...
Felicity: As entertaining as this conversation is, Viola, I must return to my chores. If you'll excuse me...
(Felicity leaves the scene.)
Viola: Ah, wait! ... And she's gone. Either I'm bad at math or Felicity's hiding something. ... I should probably review my textbooks.

Viola: Felicity! I've figured it out!
Felicity: Figured out what, exactly?
Viola: Your age! I now know why my calculations were off.
Felicity: Oh?
Viola: I've been going about it all wrong. You're just older than you look!
Felicity: Uh--
Viola: That's totally it, right? You're probably like forty or fifty and just look really young for your age!
Felicity: Oh! Um, yes. You got it right, Viola! Haha...
Viola: No need to be embarrassed about it! My mother was like that too. You look really good for fifty!
Felicity: Wh-Why thank you, Viola. I, er, appreciate you saying so.
Viola: Of course! Oh, and don't worry. I won't tell anyone. A lady's gotta have her secrets, after all.
Felicity: I am glad you understand, Viola.
Viola: Anyway, I'm gonna head to the library. I gotta brush up on my math! See ya!
(Viola leaves.)
Felicity: Phew, that was close. I wonder if she'll figure things out... Maybe. It may take a while though.
