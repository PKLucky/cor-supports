Masashi: Ah Masashi you have the devil’s own luck! Not only have you found a most able fletcher but she is a most fetching fletcher too. And with being an archer perfect excuse to hit her up. Off we go!
??? HALT! Don’t take another step!
Masashi: Who is that? Oh it’s you sir Forrest why the grave demeanor?
Forrest: Where are you going out to?
Masashi: Why simply to take a walk around the royal city. Nothing more beyond that.
Forrest: I don’t believe you
Masashi: Forrest sir. I have done nothing amiss. Why the suspicion?
Forrest: Your loyalty is suspect at best. You abandoned your previous ties at the drop of a hat and for what? Because the opposing commander was a gorgeous woman. You are pathetic. You abandoned your liege, your knightly vows, everything. For a woman. You are a disgrace.
Masashi: But Forrest sir the emperor was not himself people needed to oppose him
Forrest: That is besides the point. Where are you heading off to?
Masashi: Is there nothing to convince you to trust me? We are on the same side here.
Forrest: Temporarily. Temporarily, and against my better judgement we are on the same side. Someone needs to keep an eye on you.
Masashi: Ah well, could be worse….hmmmm……who knows maybe Forrest will be a good wingman.
Forrest: What was that?
Masashi: Nothing, nothing sir Forrest follow me I need to see a fletcher my arrows need tending to
Forrest: They look fine to me
Masashi: Irrelevant good man, don’t worry about it.

Masashi: Ah and here we are at the fletcher's establishment
Forrest: So it would seem and why did you pick this one?
Masashi: No reason anyway in we go!
???: Hello handsome gents how can I help you? Oh it's you Masashi back so soon?
Masashi: Yes I'm afraid my arrows are a little bent and I was worried the fletching might come off and that just won't do especially if I see my Cupid's Mark.
???: Hee-hee oh you, ok I'll examine them for you
Forrest: You shouldn't encourage him miss if he's bothering you just say the word and I'll haul him off to the dungeons
Masashi: You wouldn't!
???: You would?
Forrest: Yes.
???: Oh my the big bold Forrest protecting me from the pesky archer I don't know what to do. I think I might swoon
Forrest: I'll haul him off then
Masashi: No wait-
???: I was being dramatic Forrest, Masashi isn't being any more annoying than any other customer he's just a lot more fun and entertaining
Forrest: Oh. If you're sure
???: Good grief! Can you lighten up already? How do you expect to win the princess' heart if you're as stoic as a stone?
Masashi: Wait Forrest wants to marry the princess?
Forrest: No
???: Yes. Everyone knows it
Masashi: Forrest my man why didn't you say so? I can help you win her
Forrest: I don't need help
???: Yes he does
Masashi: Yes you do good sir. You've got no charm, no style Come let us go to a restaurant we need to practice and hone in your act
Forrest: My act?
Masashi: You got to get your game on Forrest!
