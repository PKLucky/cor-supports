Masashi: Ah Masashi you have the devil’s own luck! Not only have you found a most able fletcher but she is a most fetching fletcher too. And with being an archer perfect excuse to hit her up. Off we go!
??? HALT! Don’t take another step!
Masashi: Who is that? Oh it’s you sir Forrest why the grave demeanor?
Forrest: Where are you going out to?
Masashi: Why simply to take a walk around the royal city. Nothing more beyond that.
Forrest: I don’t believe you
Masashi: Forrest sir. I have done nothing amiss. Why the suspicion?
Forrest: Your loyalty is suspect at best. You abandoned your previous ties at the drop of a hat and for what? Because the opposing commander was a gorgeous woman. You are pathetic. You abandoned your liege, your knightly vows, everything. For a woman. You are a disgrace.
Masashi: But Forrest sir the emperor was not himself people needed to oppose him
Forrest: That is besides the point. Where are you heading off to?
Masashi: Is there nothing to convince you to trust me? We are on the same side here.
Forrest: Temporarily. Temporarily, and against my better judgement we are on the same side. Someone needs to keep an eye on you.
Masashi: Ah well, could be worse….hmmmm……who knows maybe Forrest will be a good wingman.
Forrest: What was that?
Masashi: Nothing, nothing sir Forrest follow me I need to see a fletcher my arrows need tending to
Forrest: They look fine to me
Masashi: Irrelevant good man, don’t worry about it.
