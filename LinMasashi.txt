(Masashi draws his bow.)
Masashi: Leave the girl alone.
Ruffian 1: Oi, you think you can take us on, chump? Yer outnumbered three t' two!
Masashi: I can if I have to. Best to surrender now. This arrow will be loosed eventually. Besides, it's getting a little hard holding this bow drawn.
Ruffian 2: Ha! Big words for a runt like you--
(Masashi fires the arrow.)
Ruffian 2: AUGH!
(The ruffian falls.)
Masashi: Whoops. String must have slipped.
Ruffian 3: What the?! Why you--
(Masashi quickly draws another arrow and fires.)
Ruffian 3: GAH!
(The ruffian falls.)
Ruffian 1: A-Ah...! I-I'm outta here--
(Masashi fires an arrow.)
Ruffian 1: GUH...!
(The last ruffian falls.)
Masashi: Whew... Miss Lin, are you alright?
Lin: Uh, y-yeah.
Masashi: Good. Those ruffians didn't do anything to you, did they?
Lin: No, I'm okay. But, Masashi, that was... You were like a completely different person back there.
Masashi: I apologize. You shouldn't have witnessed something so appalling. At any rate, you were heading to town, correct? I'll escort you the rest of the way.
(Masashi leaves.)
Lin: Damn, that was... He was... He's so cool! Masashi, wait up!

Lin: Masashi!
Masashi: Hello, Miss Lin. Did you need something?
Lin: I, uh, wanted to thank you for the other day. Y'know, that thing with the bandits and whatever. So, here.
Masashi: Chocolates? Oh, Miss Lin, this is very kind of you, but--
Lin: Just take them! This is embarrassing for me as is.
Masashi: I can't, Miss Lin. I understand you put a lot of thought into this, but I really shouldn't accept them.
Lin: Why not?
Masashi: I don't want to take advantage of your feelings. And I don't want you to think that I reciprocate in any way.
Lin: I... O-Oh.
Masashi: Don't misunderstand! You're an upstanding young lady, Miss Lin. But, emphasis on "young." While I'm only a few years older than you, there's a boundary that shouldn't be crossed.
Lin: But... I really like you...
Masashi: I know, I know. I was in a similar position to you, actually.
Lin: Huh?

Lin: I see... Hey, can we at least just be friends? I really like you, Masashi. And not just in that sappy, romantic way either. I wanna keep hanging out with you and talking with you.
Masashi: I...
Lin: Look, if I get too clingy or all up in your business, just tell me off! I can take it! If you don't wanna date me, fine. I get it. In that case, I'm cool with just being friends as long as you are. Deal?
Masashi: Miss Lin... Well, if you put it that way, alright. I'm fine with being friends.
Lin: Awesome. Now, I'll be taking those chocolates back, thank you very much. I gotta find someone else who'll take 'em. I'm not really a fan of sweets.
Masashi: If you don't have any ideas, I'm sure Princess Krista would be more than willing to take them off your hands.
Lin: Oh, great idea! Thanks a lot, Masashi. See ya!
Masashi: Of course. Until next time, Miss Lin.
