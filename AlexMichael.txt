Alex: Hi there. Michael, wasn't it?
Michael: Yes, ma'am. Lady Alex, ma'am.
Alex: Just call me Alex. Would you like some tea?
Michael: Yes please, ma'am. Er, Lady Alex.
(Michael sips his tea.)
Michael: ... This is good. Thank you.
Alex: Glad you think so. Now, what inspired you to become a knight?
Michael: The legends. In the stories, they always helped and defended people. I wanted to become like that.
Alex: My parents were both knights, so it was only natural I would also become one. But I, too, always enjoyed those tales of knights defending the helpless.
Michael: My former commander, Captain Irving, always said that war isn't like the stories. And that I should "get those fantasies out of my head."
Alex: I see... Sadly, that can be the case. That said, I see nothing wrong with reading those stories and being inspired by them. Many people look to songs, poetry, ballads, and tales to push them to greatness. Some believe that such tales of bravery help us reach heights of such magnitude far beyond what we would have done otherwise.
Michael: You have a point. Thank you, Alex.
Alex: You're very welcome, Michael.
Michael: Is it alright if I come see you again? The tea is good and it's nice having someone else who enjoys stories of knights. Foliaga's Holy Knights weren't what I thought they were, but maybe they're not all like that?
Alex: Of course. I'd like that. And, trust me, Michael, what you witnessed was a very unfortunate exception. I may be biased, but I have no doubt in my mind that Medeas' knights live up to how a knight should conduct themselves.
Michael: Well, if they're anything like you, I can believe that.
