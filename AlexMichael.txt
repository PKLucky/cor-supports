Alex: Hi there. Michael, wasn’t it?
Michael: Yes, ma’am. Lady Alex, ma’am.
Alex: Just call me Alex. Would you like some tea?
Michael: Yes please, ma’am. … Alex. This is good. Thank you.
Alex: Glad you think so. Now, what inspired or drove you to become a knight?
Michael: The legends. In the stories, they always helped and defended people. I wanted to become like that.
Alex: My parents were both knights, so it was only natural I would also become one. But I too always enjoyed those tales of the knights defending and protecting.
Michael: Sir Forrest says that war isn’t like the stories. Sometimes the hero doesn’t come back.
Alex: I see……..he’s not wrong Michael, sadly that is the case……(like with Sir Gibson…..poor Chell, Viola and Lin oh Lin where are you?) that said I see nothing wrong with reading those stories and being inspired them many people look to songs, poetry, ballads, and tales to inspire and push them to greatness. Some believe that such tales of bravery help us achieve greatness of such magnitude far beyond what we would have done otherwise.
Michael: Oh, ok. Thank you Lady Alex
Alex: You’re very welcome Michael
Michael: Is it alright if I come see you again? The tea is nice and it’s nice having someone else who enjoys stories of Knights and no disrespect meant but Sir Forrest doesn’t seem to understand
Alex: Of course I’d like that but let me just say don’t judge him too harshly. He’s extremely pragmatic yes but he also has to ensure the protection and safety of the royal family. If something happens to any of them the blame will fall on him.
Michael: Oh…..that doesn’t seem fair though I suppose Forrest would say “That’s life Michael, things aren’t always fair or how we think they should be.”
Alex: Hee-hee. Probably. More or less.
