Sam: Huah! Rargh! Hoorah! You're dead now!
Taylor: Huh, his axe maneuvers are better than I would've expected for one living in the wilds for so long.
Sam: Ah, Taylor! Didn't notice you there. You here to train too?
Taylor: I was, yeah. Your attacks are surprisingly accurate. Fast too.
Sam: I had a few good trainers.
Taylor: You mean Gibson?
Sam: He was one of them. Though, I encountered a few mercenaries who taught me a few things too.
Taylor: That explains it. So, what do you do when you're not training?
Sam: Kill bandits.
Taylor: Besides that.
Sam: Eat.
Taylor: Anything besides ESSENTIAL activities?
Sam: Uhh... Stare at Chell's thighs and ass?
Taylor: Ohh, somebody has a crush.
Sam: Wait, I said that out loud?
Taylor: Yup! You know what, why don't we continue this conversation in a more relaxing atmosphere?
Sam: Uh, sure?r
Taylor: Tavern here we come! Have your drinks ready!
Sam: Oh no! I don't think this is a good idea!
