Haruki: The thing about goodbyes is that you don't know when they're gonna happen, Lady Tsubaki. And you can prepare for them all you want, but it's still gonna hurt when they happen.
Tsubaki: So, what then? Just resign to being alone forever?
Haruki: Nah, that ain't good for anybody. Think about it this way: the reason it hurts is because you really cared about the person leaving, right?
Tsubaki: That's... That's true.
Haruki: And the reason you care was because you got close to them and spent so much time with them. I think that's a good thing, Lady Tsubaki. I know I'm gonna be sad once this is all over. You're gonna go back to being the princess of Merinas, and I'm gonna go back home to Aotani. But at least we'll have our memories of the good times.
Tsubaki: Yes... You're right, Haruki.
Haruki: And, hey, it doesn't have to be goodbye forever! I'll come by the castle if I can! I've got dreams of travelling the world, but that doesn't mean I won't come back to Merinas every once in a while.
Tsubaki: I'd like that very much, Haruki. I'll make sure you are welcomed with open arms.
