speak;Lucy;Hi! You're Aqua, right?
speak;Aqua;Yes, that's me. Who are you?
expression;Lucy;Smile
speak;Lucy;I'm Lucy, a healer for the Medean royal army.|{c:e;Lucy;CloseEyes,NoSmile}Well, healer in training, I mean.|{c:e;Lucy;NoSmile}My mother was the head healer for the royal army,|but since she's sick, I'm trying to fill in for her until she recovers.
expression;Aqua;Smile
speak;Aqua;Oh, I see! I happen to be a cleric of Vergrande Monastery in Foliaga.
expression;Lucy;Smile
speak;Lucy;That's so cool! So, we're both healers, then.|We should be friends!
speak;Aqua;It would be nice to have another friend, Lucy.
speak;Lucy;By the way, that's a really nice staff.|I don't think I've ever seen anything like it before.
speak;Aqua;Oh, thank you. Sam let us have it on our way back from Oregot.|{c:e;Aqua;NoSmile}It feels more powerful than the staves I normally use.|It can heal others from a good distance away.

speak;Lucy;That's amazing! Can I give it a try?
expression;Aqua;Smile
speak;Aqua;I don't see why not. Let's go to the infirmary and try it out.

speak;Lucy;Hello, Miss Joan. I just wanted to try out this new staff.|Is there anyone who needs help right now?

speak;Woman1;Why, Brennan here happened to come in with a sprained wrist earlier.|I'm sure he'd appreciate the assistance.

speak;Lucy;Aqua! I have a theory for why I can't use that staff of yours!
speak;Aqua;Oh? What is it?
speak;Lucy;Maybe the staff knows that I can ride a horse?
expression;Aqua;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Aqua;What.
expression;Lucy;NoSmile
speak;Lucy;Well, you know how some people can't learn certain types of magic?|Maybe staves have weird rules like that too!
expression;Aqua;NormalBlink
speak;Aqua;When you put it that way, I suppose that makes some sense?|{c:e;Aqua;CloseEyes}Not a LOT of sense, but I do see the logic.
expression;Lucy;CloseEyes
speak;Lucy;If only we knew someone who could use magic AND ride a horse{tgm}...
