Lucy: Hi! You're Aqua, right?
Aqua: Yes, that's me. Who are you?
Lucy: I'm Lucy, a healer for the Medean royal army. Well, healer in training, I mean. My mother was the head healer for the royal army, but since she's sick, I'm trying to fill in for her until she recovers.
Aqua: Oh, I see! I happen to be a cleric of Vergrande Monastery in Foliaga.
Lucy: That's so cool! So, we're both healers, then. We should be friends!
Aqua: It would be nice to have another friend, Lucy.
Lucy: By the way, that's a really nice staff. I don't think I've ever seen anything like it before.
Aqua: Oh, thank you. Sam let us have it on our way back from Oregot. It feels more powerful than the staves I normally use. It can heal others from a good distance away.
Lucy: That's amazing! Can I give it a try?
Aqua: I don't see why not. Let's go to the infirmary and try it out.
(Scene transitions to the infirmary.)
Nurse: Oh, Lucy! Did you need something?
Lucy: Hello, Miss Joan. I just wanted to try out this new staff. Is there anyone who needs help right now?
Nurse: Why, Brennan here happened to come in with a sprained wrist earlier. I'm sure he'd appreciate the assistance.
Lucy: Okay! Here we go!
(Lucy tries to use the staff.)
Lucy: ...
Nurse: ...
Lucy: Um. Wait, let me try again.
(Lucy tries again.)
Lucy: ...
Aqua: ...
Nurse: Lucy, are you sure that staff works?
Lucy: I'm sure it does! I've seen Aqua use it all the time. Here, Aqua, show her.
Aqua: Alright.
(Aqua uses the staff.)
Patient: Ah, I feel so much better. Thank you!
Nurse: Thank you very much for your help, you two.
Aqua: Yes, of course.
(Scene transitions outside the infirmary.)
Aqua: That's so strange...
Lucy: You can say that again. Looks like we've got a mystery on our hands, Aqua. Let's figure out what's with that staff!

Lucy: Aqua! I have a theory for why I can't use that staff of yours!
Aqua: Oh? What is it?
Lucy: Maybe the staff knows that I can ride a horse?
Aqua: What.
Lucy: Well, you know how some people can't learn certain types of magic? Maybe staves have weird rules like that too!
Aqua: When you put it that way, I suppose that makes some sense? Not a LOT of sense, but I do see the logic.
Lucy: If only we knew someone who could use magic AND ride a horse... WAIT A MINUTE!
(Scene transitions to a different part of the castle.)
Lucy: ... And that's why we came to you, Sir Forrest!
Forrest: Lucy, I understand, but you DO realize I cannot use staves anyway, correct?
Lucy: Have you tried?
Forrest: ... Hand it over.
(Forrest tries using the staff.)
Forrest: ...
Lucy: ... Nothing happened.
Forrest: This more than likely doesn't prove anything, Lucy. I'm sorry to say, but this may have just been a waste of time.
Lucy: Man...
Aqua: Maybe the Medean Castle library has some books on it?
Lucy: Aqua, that's a great idea! We're gonna head over there now, Sir Forrest. Thanks for your help!
(Aqua and Lucy leave the scene.)
Forrest: But I didn't do anything?
