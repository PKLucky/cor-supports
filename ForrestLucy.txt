Forrest: Hello, Lucy. I see you and Bessie are doing well.
Lucy: Yup! Looks like you and Macintosh are doing good too.
Forrest: How are you holding up after your first taste of combat?
Lucy: Doing okay. A lot of people got hurt, though.
Forrest: That's war, Lucy. People are going to get hurt. That's why it's imperative that there's always at least one medic on hand. Preferably more. And with you able to dash around on your horse, you can get to people that those on foot cannot.
Lucy: I know, Sir Forrest. I like making people feel better, patching up their boo-boos and all that.
Forrest: Their "boo-boos"?
Lucy: Yeah! You know their ouchies!
Forrest, thinking: Medea, please tell me this is NOT how she explains the healing craft to people.
Forrest: Yes... Of course.
Lucy: I just wish I could help Mom get better though. She was--Is the best.
Forrest: She is. We're lucky she taught you what she knew before her illness came.
Lucy: I just wish I could help her.
Forrest: You are. Knowing you're helping in her place is helping her, Lucy. She doesn't have to worry that no one is tending to those getting hurt.
Lucy: Really?
Forrest: Yes. Just keep it up.
Lucy: Okay! I'll do my best and become the best healer ever! Other than Mom, of course.
Forrest: Of course.
Lucy: I'm gonna go practice my healing magic! See you later, Sir Forrest!
(Lucy leaves the scene.)
Forrest: I hope for her sake her mother does recover, but this illness that has afflicted her is a strange one. No one seems to know what it is.

A?
??? Cough, cough...
Lucy: Come on! It should work!
??? "It's no good little one there's no fixing that injury!
Lucy: But..but you can't die Mr. Mason
Mason: Ah don't fret over me I did my duty, I did my best as you did. That's all a person can do, you're a good youngin' take care of yourself and look after everyone
Forrest: ....
Forrest: You alright Lucy?
Lucy: It's not fair Sir Forrest why did he have to die? I tried and tried but the staff wouldn't heal
Forrest: You did the best you could sometimes even magic has it's limits
Lucy: But he was a good man, he would tell me the funniest stories
Forrest: Both good and bad men die in war alike it's how it is, sometimes according to my father one soldier will die because he was protecting another
Lucy: Still...I wish I could have done something
Forrest: You did, talking to you was the closest thing to him seeing his grandchildren maybe he couldn't say good bye to his own family but he could say goodbye to you and through you say goodbye to his family
Lucy: That's sad Sir Forrest! He should be able to see his family not die in some war camp away from home
Forrest: Yes Lucy, he should have been able to die at home but sadly war is not kind like that it's harsh, unkind and brutal. But he saved the lives of many soldiers yesterday who will at least have the chance to make it home
Lucy: ....Sir Forrest?
Forrest: Yes?
Lucy: I still don't like it I wish he could have made it home but thank you
Forrest: You're welcome Lucy (leaves)
Lucy: Let's do our best Bessie, let's try to make sure as many soldiers can make it home to their families agains as possible
Bessie: Neigh!
Lucy: Of course you too
Bessie: Neigh?
Lucy: Yes you can have some sugar, here you go
Bessie: Neigh!
Lucy: Yes you're right I do still have other people who need my help to, let's go help them get better.
