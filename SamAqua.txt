Aqua: You need an adult to supervise you and as such I will watch over you and make sure nothing happens to you or anyone else
Sam: Well what’s that going to do for me?
Aqua: With me around I can keep you patched up without you stopping to chug a vulnery allowing you to keep killing bandits you can keep killing bandits you can kill them as much as 35% more efficently

Sam and Aqua; A?
Aqua- Sam! That was my last use of the heal staff and there’s still more bandits coming!
Sam- Yup! Sure looks like it!
Aqua: You can’t keep fighting you’re bleeding as it is and I’m OUT of heal staff.
Sam: You’re too good for this world Aqua always trying to cure the hurts of others, protect them, ease their pain. Now it’s my turn to protect you.
Aqua: What are you going to?
Sam: Time for me to cast a spell of my own.
Aqua: When did you learn to cast
Sam: I cast…..DEATH!
Aqua: But that’s an elder magic spell! And it’s impossible for you to cast such an incantation!
Sam “COME HERE YA’ LOUSY STINKIN’ BANDITS? YA’ THINK I’M SCARED OF YOU? HUH? DO YA’?
Aqua: Oh goddess, we’re doomed
Sam: When the bandits come into view I’m going to kick these barrels in their direction.
Aqua: Those barrels hold black powder and kerosene that could be dangerous
Sam: Yup! Sure could be, then I’m going to throw this at the bandits and barrels
Aqua: BUT THAT’S A MINE!
Sam: Exactly when that happens you start running like a thief out of the royal treasury.
Aqua: What about you? You’re not going to die are you?
Sam: Who can say? I might but rule number one about bandit huning.
Aqua: Yes?
Sam: ALWAYS make sure the cleric lives. Well unless it’s the bandits’ cleric then you kill her ASAP
Aqua: Wha HUH????
Sam: Point is ALWAYS look out for the Cleric.  Now go, I’m going to throw this
Aqua: But what about you
Sam: I said GO! They’re not exactly waiting around. RUN! GO!
Sam: ALRIGHT YA’ STINKING BANDITS! IT’S BBQ TIME!!! HA-HA-HA-HA!
BOOM KA-BOOM-BOOM BOOM! BOOM BOOM!
Aqua: Sam?......Why? Why? Why? You stupid man if only my staff hadn’t run out. Oh goddess I failed
????: Hey Aqua got a vulnery on you? I got a little singed.
Aqua: SMACK! Don’t EVER do that again. YOU HEAR ME? You could have died doing that.
Sam: Alright
Aqua: Let’s get back to camp and get a salve on that. Oh and Sam?
Sam: Yeah?
Aqua: Thanks for looking out for me.
