speak;Aqua;Azure, how has traveling with the troupe been so far?
expression;Azure;Smile
speak;Azure;Quite well.|You know, once they knew I had a sister,|they begged me to take you along with us if we stopped near the monastery again.
speak;Aqua;Oh?
speak;Azure;They would go on and on about meeting you.|{c:e;Azure;CloseEyes,Smile}"Oh, Azure, why are you hiding your sister from us?"|"Is she as cute as you are?"
expression;Aqua;Smile
speak;Aqua;Haha! I see.{c:e;Aqua;NoSmile}I wouldn't even know what I would do if I came with you, though.|{c:e;Aqua;CloseEyes}I don't play an instrument, my singing voice isn't all that great,|and I don't know the first thing about dancing.
expression;Azure;NormalBlink,NoSmile
speak;Azure;I didn't either before I joined them.
expression;Aqua;NormalBlink
speak;Aqua;But you've always been so graceful with your movements.|Becoming a dancer just seemed so natural for you.
expression;Azure;Smile
speak;Azure;Really now? Since we're twins, I'd imagine some of that grace is in you too.
speak;Aqua;Do you think so?
speak;Azure;Sure I do. In fact, we can prove that easily.|I'll teach you one of the first dances I learned while in the troupe.|If you can grasp that, then that'll be proof enough.
expression;Aqua;CloseEyes
speak;Aqua;Hmm{tgm}...{tgm} If anything, it sounds like it would be fun.|{c:e;Aqua;NormalBlink,Smile}Alright, Azure, let's do it!
