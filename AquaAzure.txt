Aqua: Azure, how has traveling with the troupe been so far?
Azure: Quite well. You know, once they knew I had a sister, they begged me to take you along with us if we stopped near the monastery again.
Aqua: Oh?
Azure: They would go on and on about meeting you. "Oh, Azure, why are you hiding your sister from us?" "Is she as cute as you are?"
Aqua: Haha! I see. I wouldn't even know what I would do if I came with you, though. I don't play an instrument, my singing voice isn't all that great, and I don't know the first thing about dancing.
Azure: I didn't either before I joined them.
Aqua: But you've always been so graceful with your movements. Becoming a dancer just seemed so natural for you.
Azure: Really now? Since we're twins, I'd imagine some of that grace is in you too.
Aqua: Do you think so?
Azure: Sure I do. In fact, we can prove that easily. I'll teach you one of the first dances I learned while in the troupe. If you can grasp that, then that'll be proof enough.
Aqua: Hmm... If anything, it sounds like it would be fun. Alright, Azure, let's do it!
