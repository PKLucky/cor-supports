Kai: So what can you tell me about Joshua, the pit fighter. He uses a massive sword.
Arena man: Oh him! Boy that guy brings us in so much money and he’s great at entertaining the crowd too.
Kai: Fascinating, what can you tell me about his sword.
Arena man. Oh his sword? That thing is massive why it’s far too big and thick to be called a sword it is far too heavy and rough. Why in fact it’s much more like a large hunk of iron.
Kai: You don’t say. Why does he use such an unwieldy weapon? Any way of countering or defending against it? Most weapons and armor would fair poorly against it.
Arena Man: Aye lad my suggestion would be use something to hit him first such as a spear or if you could get a parrying weapon like a thick shortsword or dagger that would be your best bet against him.
Kai: My thanks sir, here some gold for your time Kai leaves
Kai with a merchant “Thank you good sir this is exactly what I was looking for.
Scene change
Joshua: Hiyah! Hoo yah!.......not quite right. Again shoot at me again.
Kai to random standerby: What’s he doing?
??? He’s been having the archers shoot at him, he says he’s trying to deflect the arrows with his sword
Kai: Hmmmm……(not bad, his movements are a little slow though but still it’s impressive that he can wield that thing as fast as he does) Hey Joshua!
Joshua: Huh? Oh hi Kai what’s up?
Kai: Want to take a break and spar again?
Joshua: Sure maybe I’m trying too hard at this.
They spar back and forth
Joshua: I got you now Kai! Ha!....What? Huh?
Kai: Gotcha big guy.I decided to get myself a parrying dagger.
Joshua: Smart. And by crossing your blades like that you can throw my blade off course without risking the integrity of your own since they’re sharing the weight.
Kai: Exactly. Looks like I win
Joshua: Looks like it indeed.
Kai: So what was that about earlier? The archers shooting you.
Joshua: My dad left this manual behind with all of his techniques some borrowed some he invented. He was strong Kai, really strong and fast too. When he wielded Old Iron here, he wielded this weapon like it weighed nothing. The sword was a blur he would have merchants hurl their baskets of melons in the air and EVERY melon would be cut in half when it landed in the basket again
Kai: He was good then, real good (damn that’s impressive and with how big that sword is? Wow) What happened to him?
Joshua: He died…….such is the life for those who live by the sword. It’s a shame he was a real good sword fighter, a good mercenary he sometimes supplemented merc work with arena fights just to keep money coming in.
Kai: Fascinating
Joshua: What about you? How’s your dad?
Kai: Also dead.
Joshua: Sorry to hear that
Kai: Don’t be.
Joshua: Huh?
Kai: Like you said those that live by the sword die by the sword. He got careless and sloppy and paid the consequences for it.

Later
Kai: So why do you keep that manual anyway?
Joshua: I’m trying to master my father’s techniques some of them I got others are…..sloppy at best. I’m still a far cry from my father. He was strong and fast, very fast. You wouldn’t think it to look at him but he could strike faster than a snake with the precision of a stalking cat
Kai: If I can make a suggestion
Joshua: Go ahead
Kai: Your strength is excellent but what you lack is speed I could help you train to move faster. Your strength and defense is excellent and your skill isn’t shabby either but your speed is lacking
Joshua: Not a bad idea maybe then I can pull off some of my father’s more advanced techniques.
