Chell: Wooh. That was a good training session. Still feels like I have more to improve upon.
Taiga: Hey, you're Chell right?
Chell: Yes that's me, and you're Taiga I believe
Taiga: Yeah that's me. You seem pretty strong
Chell: Oh, why thank you. I have to be, it's not easy using axes plus I have to look out for my sisters as best as I can
Taiga: Yeah axes make you strong for sure. Want to do some strength training with me?
Chell: What's strength training?
Taiga: You know, picking things up and putting them down. Heavy stuff especially it makes you strong and makes your muscles bigger
Chell: And why is that a good thing?
Taiga: It makes you stronger! Plus it's fun! Come on I'll show you!
Taiga drags Chell off)
Taiga: And here we are Taiga's Training Center!
Chell: It's just a bunch of barrels, stones and logs.
Taiga: Yup and lifting these up and down makes you stronger. A few years ago I could barely roll this barrel here. Now look!
Chell: Goodness you can actually lift that?
Taiga: Sure can, I bet you can too with some practice and it would make you better in combat.
Chell: You know what this sounds fun
Taiga: Awesome! Let's get out of our armor and into some training clothes it's better to be in something light for this
Scene blacks out back with Taiga and Chell in training attire)
Taiga: Ok so for these sacks and rocks you want to get down low and just bear hug the object, get it real close to you and then heave up driving with your legs and ass and then you're upright
Chell: Ok...so like this
Taiga: Not bad but widen your stance a little, ok better.
