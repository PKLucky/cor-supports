Alex: Hmmm... Oh, these herbs smell very nice. You wouldn't happen to have any matcha green tea, would you?
Pretty Merchant Girl: Give me a moment and I'll check.
(Masashi enters the scene.)
Masashi: Oh! I wasn't expecting to see you here. Alex, wasn't it? One of Princess Krista's knights.
Alex: Hm? Oh yes, that's me. Who are you again?
Masashi: I'm Masashi! You know, the shogun from Merinas.
Alex: Ah, right. Yes, you basically seduced your way into the army.
Masashi: I most certainly did not!
Alex: You most certainly did.
Masashi: ANYWAY, as I was trying to say, I wasn't expecting to see you here, Alex.
Alex: Oh, do you come here often?
Masashi: N-No, not particularly. I just happened to be passing through, and--
Merchant: He comes here nearly every day, madam. By the way, here's your matcha leaves.
Alex: Thank you. Could you set those aside for now? I'd like to keep browsing. You have an excellent selection of tea and herbs. I don't often see such an assortment.
Merchant: Certainly! Keep browsing.
Masashi: Matcha tea? I never would have expected a girl from Medeas to be familiar or be interested in it.
Alex: I like reading about different types of teas, so I knew of it, at least. I tried it for the first time when we stopped in Gintoki City, actually. It's very good. So, why do you come here every day, Masashi?
Masashi: Oh, you know, just to make sure the healers and such have the herbs they need to--
Merchant: He comes to whisper sweet nothings to me. Something about how I "put even the beauty of the sun to shame."
Alex: Oh? Am I interrupting something, then?
Masashi: Er, well--No! Absolutely nothing! But since I am here anyway, I may as well compliment such a pretty merch--
Alex: And I'm NOT pretty? Come on, Masashi. I'm standing right here.
Masashi: I never said that!!

Alex: Thank you for offering to carry my packages Masashi, it was a very gentamanly gesture of you
Masashi: Why of course 'tis only proper
Alex: Well it's very appreciated after all those parcels are SOOOOOO heavy I have no idea how little 'ol me would have managed if a big, strong archer hadn't been nearby at the time
Masashi: Well...uh...um...thanks Lady Alex, this is a first.
Alex: What is?
Masashi: Being complimented, but since you don't seem to despise my company how about a nice pot of tea? I know of several fine tea shops that a connoisseur of tea such as yourself would appreciate
Alex: Thank Masashi I'd like that
Some time later
Alex: So chamomile is excellent for relaxation especially if one is having a lot of stress or has trouble sleeping, meanwhile peppermint is an excellent tea for the winter but is good for both digestion and warding off diseases, while ginger tea is a great cure for colds, sore throats among other benefits
Masashi: My, my. I would have never guessed that such a lovely knight as yourself would be so well-versed and informed on tea and herbs
Alex: I wanted to be a healer but I have no talent-
Masashi: Oh come now a lady such as yourself has plenty of talent
Alex: Isn't it rude to interrupt a lady Masashi?
Masashi: Er...yes of course my apologies
Alex: I shall grace you with my benevolence and forgive you but as I was saying I have no talent for healing magic, however I was able to grasp the healing properties of herbs and teas and with them I can at least make salves and vulneraries
Masashi: That's great! I'm sure the infirmary is glad to have you around. How about poetry and dancing did you as a knight learn such finer arts
Alex: I don't know what knights in Merinas learn but in Medeas yes every knight learns of the finer arts. Art in all it's forms including song, dance and poetry.
Masashi: I'd love to invite you to a dance sometime if you would be so inclined
Alex: I'd enjoy that Masashi but we should get back soon, some other time of course
Masashi: Of course, allow me to escort you and deliver your parcels
Alex: That would be most kind of you Masashi
