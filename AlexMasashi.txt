Alex- “Hmmm…oh these herbs smell very nice. You wouldn’t happen to have any Matcha Green tea would you?
Pretty Merchant Girl- Give me a moment and I’ll check.
??? “Oh! I wasn’t expecting to see you here, Alex wasn’t it? One of Princess Krista’s knights.
Alex- “Hm? Oh yes that’s me. Who are you again?
Masashi “I’m Masashi! You know, the Archer from Merinas
Alex- Oh! You right, yes you basically seduced your way into the army
Masashi- I MOST CERTAINLY DID NOT!

Masashi- ANYWAY, I wasn’t expecting to see you here Alex.
Alex- Oh do you come here often?
Masashi “Oh just now and-
??? He comes here nearly every day madam, by the way here’s your Matcha Tea
Alex- Thank you, could you set it aside for now? I’d like to keep browsing you have an excellent selection of tea and herbs. I don’t often see such an assortment
Merchant Girl- Certainly! Keep browsing.
Masashi: Matcha Tea? I never would have expected a girl of Merineas to be familiar or be interested in it.
Alex: Oh yes, it’s very good. (Looks over other teas) So why do you come here every day Masashi?
Masashi: Oh you know, just to make sure the healers and such have the herbs they need to
Tea Merchant “ He comes to insinuate sweet nothings to me. Something about that I “Put even the beauty of the sun to shame”
Alex- Oh? You come to flirt with the tea merchant?
Masashi- Errr……well since I’m here anyway I may as well compliment such a pretty merch
Alex- And I’m NOT pretty? Is that why you haven’t flirted with me yet?
Masashi- I NEVER said that!!!
