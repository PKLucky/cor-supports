Alex: Hmmm... Oh, these herbs smell very nice. You wouldn't happen to have any matcha green tea, would you?
Pretty Merchant Girl: Give me a moment and I'll check.
(Masashi enters the scene.)
Masashi: Oh! I wasn't expecting to see you here. Alex, wasn't it? One of Princess Krista's knights.
Alex: Hm? Oh yes, that's me. Who are you again?
Masashi: I'm Masashi! You know, the shogun from Merinas.
Alex: Ah, right. Yes, you basically seduced your way into the army.
Masashi: I most certainly did not!
Alex: You most certainly did.
Masashi: ANYWAY, as I was trying to say, I wasn't expecting to see you here, Alex.
Alex: Oh, do you come here often?
Masashi: N-No, not particularly. I just happened to be passing through, and--
Merchant: He comes here nearly every day, madam. By the way, here's your matcha leaves.
Alex: Thank you. Could you set those aside for now? I'd like to keep browsing. You have an excellent selection of tea and herbs. I don't often see such an assortment.
Merchant: Certainly! Keep browsing.
Masashi: Matcha tea? I never would have expected a girl from Medeas to be familiar or be interested in it.
Alex: I like reading about different types of teas, so I knew of it, at least. I tried it for the first time when we stopped in Gintoki City, actually. It's very good. So, why do you come here every day, Masashi?
Masashi: Oh, you know, just to make sure the healers and such have the herbs they need to--
Merchant: He comes to whisper sweet nothings to me. Something about how I "put even the beauty of the sun to shame."
Alex: Oh? Am I interrupting something, then?
Masashi: Er, well--No! Absolutely nothing! But since I am here anyway, I may as well compliment such a pretty merch--
Alex: And I'm NOT pretty? Come on, Masashi. I'm standing right here.
Masashi: I never said that!!
