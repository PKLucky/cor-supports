Marina “Why hello there Kai, seeing you does put a spring in a girl’s step
Kai “Morning there Marina, pleasure seeing you as well
Marina “I did want to say that you are an extraordinarily handsome young man. In fact if you were so inclined you could very easily do other types of work
Kai “Oh? Other work you say. If you’re offering Marina I don’t do such work for free. (pause in between here and the next sentence) I don’t do it cheap either
Marina “So unperturbed. I didn’t say I was offering, so you’ve done such work before then?
Kai “Sure have. Comes with being a ninja.
Marina “hmmm perhaps I should have dated a ninja then
Kai “Maybe you should have (smirking)
Marina “Perhaps I will soon, maybe I should see you in action myself
Kai “Can you make it worth my while? Like I said I don’t charge cheap and I want it to be worth my while beyond mere monetary gain.
Marina “The question is not if I am worth your time or not Kai but are YOU worth MY time?
Kai (taken aback not sure how to respond)
Marina “When you have an answer to my question, come find me.
Kai “Yes Miss Marina”
Marina leaving “Oh and Kai? Don’t make a lady wait too long. Us women will only wait so long on a man.”
Kai “huh was not expecting things to go like that. Got to mull this over and then maybe I’ll give her my answer.
