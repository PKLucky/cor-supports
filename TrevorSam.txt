speak;Trevor;Ah Sam, my lusty axe fighter! How did you come into possession of a Wind tome?|And what were you doing with it exactly?|You seem to have no magical potential to speak of.
speak;Sam;I took it from a bandit's corpse.
speak;Trevor;Ah yes, of course.|But why keep it at your cabin? Why not sell it?
expression;Sam;Smile
speak;Sam;I found that if I kept it open, it kept the cabin cool during the summer.|Quite the breeze too.
expression;Trevor;NoSmile
speak;Trevor;I beg your pardon? You kept it to cool off your house?
expression;Sam;NoSmile
speak;Sam;Sure did. The old place gets hot in the summer.|{c:e;Sam;Smile}Oh, there was a Fire tome too.
expression;Trevor;CloseEyes
speak;Trevor;Please don't say you used that to keep the cabin warm in the winter.
speak;Sam;Nope, I used it to cook with!
expression;Trevor;NormalBlink
speak;Trevor;What?? What did you do?|Tear it up and use its pages as ignition fuel?
expression;Sam;NoSmile
speak;Sam;No man, that's crazy. Only someone inept at starting a campfire does that.|{c:e;Sam;Smile}I found that if I struck a piece of wood across the book,|it would catch on fire and then the rest is easy.
expression;Trevor;CloseEyes
speak;Trevor;That is even worse.|{c:e;Trevor;NormalBlink}Thank you, my boisterous friend.|This conversation has been enlightening, but I need to take a reprieve.

speak;Sam;How can someone talk so much but say so little?|And why was he so upset at such simple practical uses of something|otherwise useless?

speak;Trevor;S-Sam?! You startled me. What're--|I mean, what may you be doing in the castle library?
speak;Sam;Wanted to find something for a light read. What are you up to?
speak;Trevor;Reviewing the fundamentals of magic.|Quite frankly, our conversation the other day has vexed me for some time now.
expression;Sam;NoSmile
speak;Sam;Got a problem with how I used those tomes?
expression;Trevor;CloseEyes
speak;Trevor;Not exactly.|{c:e;Trevor;NormalBlink}Though your activation methods were{tgm}...{tgm} unconventional,|the tomes you acquired were able to perform their intended functions.|Yet, you have no magical potential to speak of.
speak;Sam;Uh-huh?
speak;Trevor;Magical tomes act as amplifiers to a user's magic potential.|If there is no potential, then they simply won't work.
speak;Sam;Okay{tgm}...?
expression;Trevor;CloseEyes
speak;Trevor;You cannot create something out of nothing, Sam. That is just simple logic at work.|{c:e;Trevor;NormalBlink}With that in mind, I realized the answer I sought was in front of me all along!
expression;Sam;CloseEyes
speak;Sam;I don't like where this is going{tgm}...
expression;Trevor;Smile
speak;Trevor;Sam, my dear friend, you actually DO have magical potential within yourself!|That is why I would like to propose--
expression;Sam;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Sam;Nope. Nuh-uh. I'm not hearing it.

speak;Sam;Trevor, I ain't gonna start using some stupid spells just because you|figured out that I could.
speak;Trevor;That is not what I was about to say at all!|You are much too proficient with the axe to even consider quitting that.
expression;Sam;NormalBlink
speak;Sam;Huh. Color me surprised. Then, what were you gonna say?
expression;Trevor;Smile
speak;Trevor;I would like to closely observe you using your tomes.|You may be doing something that even the most learned scholars have not thought of.
speak;Sam;You're just gonna observe? No weird experiments or anything?
expression;Trevor;CloseEyes,Smile
speak;Trevor;Not unless you want to.
expression;Sam;CloseEyes,Smile
speak;Sam;And I don't.|{c:e;Sam;Smile,NormalBlink}Alright, Trevor, you can watch me use them.|I'll let you know when I've got some free time.
