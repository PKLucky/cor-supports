Chell: Sam, do you have a moment?
Sam: Sure do. What's up?
Chell: You've been in Oregot this whole time?
Sam: Pretty much.
Chell: How did you happen to get the cabin you have?
Sam: Shortly after I left, I was recruited by a mercenary company. They helped me. Gave me training. We cleared out that cabin when it was being used as a bandit hangout. Eventually, I left them and went solo. I went back to that old cabin, cleaned it up a bit, and just used it as a base of operations, so to speak.
Chell: Oh. It's rather large for someone all alone.
Sam: Yeah, a little. But there's still too many bandits. Once Oregot is safer, I'll probably settle down with someone, but not yet.
Chell: You mean you don't have a girlfriend? Perhaps a pretty girl mercenary?
Sam: No, been too busy killing bandits, tracking down the one who killed your parents, and all that.
Chell: You... killed that brigand?
Sam: Still tracking him down. He's in Oregot, I know that much. I got some of his captains, but not him yet. By the way, how's Lin doing? She'd be part of the Pegasus Knight unit by now, right?
Chell: She left, Sam. She went on her own two years ago.
[IF Lin hasn't been recruited]
Chell: I haven't heard from her since the goodbye note she left.
[ELSE]
Chell: She said she was going to be a mercenary.
[END]
Chell: I only hope she's still alive and well.
Sam: I... I see. But anyway, I'm going to go train want to come?
Chell: I would love to. It's been too long.

Chell: Sam you said you don't have anyone special? Like no girl you met amongst the mercenaries or perhaps a pretty damsel you rescued from bandits?
Sam: Ha-ha- no. I have saved various damsels before, merchants, travelers, etc but no one that's caught my eye...besides...
Chell: Besides?
Sam: The life I'm living out in the mountains, clearing out the bandits that's no life for a girl especially a girl I might consider to mean something to me
Chell: You're not wrong, and that's sweet of you to think of things like that
Sam: Oh..thank you?
Chell: But it's not life for a man either Sam, think about it. All alone, no one to talk to, to share a meal with...
Sam: Hmmm
Chell: You've done that for how many years now?
Sam: Uhhh...eight I think...
Chell: Eight years that's a lot of cold bed nights
Sam: Yeah...Chell what are you getting at?
Chell: My point is Sam I'm sure the right girl would go anywhere with you including into bandit infested Oregot and she would help you clear it of bandits
Sam: I suppose that's true enough...
Chell: There's no supposing about it! What you are aspiring to do while noble and brave is foolish. How long until you finish? How long until you clear Oregot?
Sam: Never thought about it, as long as it takes.
Chell: And you just expect the girl to wait?
Sam: Well...never thought about that before
Chell: Please do the right girl will go with you the right girl will want to go with you Sam, it's too big to do all yourself
Sam: Thanks Chell, I'll think about what you said you shared some insight I never considered
Chell: You're welcome Sam
Sam: I'm going to go eat, I need to mull over what you said
Chell: Ok
Sam: I'm just not sure who the right girl might be...ok see you
Chell: Is he dense? Or am I unattractive? Is he not attracted to me anymore?...he can't possibly be oblivious to my hint can he? Can he??? How more obvious can I be that I will go with him into Oregot to help him bandits or no. Is he just dense?

Sam: ... Oh! You thought I was talking about your bo--
Chell: Sam, please!

Base Convo
Sam: You're strong, Chell. Very strong. And your axe skills are nothing to look down at either.
Chell: Seems we have two things in common then.
Sam: What's that mean?
(Chell moves closer.)
Chell: Your chest is a LOT bigger than before. So are your arms.
(Sam backs up a pace.)
Sam: Uhhh... thanks? Anyway, why'd you keep using an axe?
Chell: You left and father had died. I guess it was kind of a way to be connected to you. To practice with a weapon you were so fond of. Besides... father liked the axe a lot, too.
Sam: He sure did. He was fast and smooth with how he wielded it. I remember seeing him deflect arrows with the blade of his axe.
Chell: Yeah. (Smiles) Want to go train?
Sam: Sure!
Chell: Just give me a moment to put on my training clothes. It's hot today, so I'm going to wear something light. I'm thinking my shorts today.
Sam: You mean the short ones?
Chell: Yup, sure do.
Sam: Exactly how short are they?
Chell: Very. That's not going to be a... distraction, is it, Sam?
Sam: Uhhhh... Define "distraction."
