speak;Chell;Sam, do you have a moment?
speak;Sam;Sure do. What's up?
speak;Chell;You've been in Oregot this whole time?
speak;Sam;Pretty much.
speak;Chell;How did you happen to get the cabin you have?
speak;Sam;Shortly after I left, I was recruited by a mercenary company.|They helped me. Gave me training.|We cleared out that cabin when it was being used as a bandit hangout.|Eventually, I left them and went solo.|I went back to that old cabin, cleaned it up a bit,|and just used it as a base of operations, so to speak.
speak;Chell;Oh. It's rather large for someone all alone.
speak;Sam;Yeah, a little. But there's still too many bandits.|Once Oregot is safer, I'll probably settle down with someone, but not yet.
speak;Chell;You mean you don't have a girlfriend? Perhaps a pretty girl mercenary?
speak;Sam;No, been too busy killing bandits,|tracking down the one who killed your parents, and all that.
speak;Chell;You{tgm}...{tgm} killed that brigand?
speak;Sam;Still tracking him down. He's in Oregot, I know that much.|I got some of his captains, but not him yet.|{c:e;Sam;Smile}By the way, how's Lin doing?|She'd be part of the Pegasus Knight unit by now, right?
expression;Chell;CloseEyes
speak;Chell;She left, Sam.{c:e;Chell;NormalBlink} She went on her own two years ago.|{e:"I haven't heard from her since the goodbye note she left." if game.get_unit('Lin').team != 'player' else "She said she was going to be a mercenary."}|{c:e;Chell;CloseEyes}I only hope she's still alive and well.
expression;Sam;HalfCloseEyes,NoSmile
speak;Sam;I{tgm}...{tgm} I see.
expression;Sam;NormalBlink
speak;Sam;But anyway, I'm going to go train want to come?
expression;Chell;NormalBlink,Smile
speak;Chell;I would love to. It's been too long.
