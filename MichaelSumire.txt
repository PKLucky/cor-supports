Sumire: zzz....zzzz....
Michael: Hello? Sumire? I'm here to take over a bed is more comfortable than leaning against a post
Sumire: Huh? Whu? Who? Oh hello! I'm the guard on watch
Michael: I know I was sent to take over so you can get some rest. I'm Michael by the way, wait you're a girl?
Sumire: I sure am! Oh you're a knight too?
Michael: Yes ma'am
Sumire: Hee-hee you don't have to ma'am me
Michael: Oh alright
Sumire: You sure you don't want some company it gets lonely out here
Michael: I'll be alright I got my armor on though if you want to stay and talk a little I don't mind
Sumire: Ok! So Michael, why'd you become a knight?
Michael: Knights are the best, I was inspired by the tales of Knights in legends!
Sumire: Cool.
