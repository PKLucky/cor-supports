speak;Masashi;Sam, you are a fellow appreciator of the female form, correct?
speak;Sam;Are you asking if I like girls? Don't all guys do?|{c:e;Sam;CloseEyes}Anyway, I don't like where this is going{tgm}...
speak;Masashi;Let's go into town, find a nice restaurant, and woo some lovely maidens.|{c:e;Masashi;NoSmile}First, though, you need to get a shirt on.

speak;Sam;Not happening.
speak;Masashi;But the staff won't let you in otherwise!
