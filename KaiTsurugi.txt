speak;Tsurugi;Wha?

speak;Tsurugi;O-Oh!|{c:e;Tsurugi;Smile,HalfCloseEyes}Haha{tgm}...{tgm} Whoops.
expression;Kai;NormalBlink,Smile
speak;Kai;So, you'd take that road, follow it for about half a mile,|turn left at the fork, and there you are.
expression;Tsurugi;NormalBlink,Smile
speak;Tsurugi;Thank you very much, Mister Kai.|I was never really good at reading maps or navigation in general.
expression;Kai;NoSmile
speak;Kai;Huh. Makes me wonder how you make those deliveries on time.
expression;Tsurugi;HalfCloseEyes,Smile
speak;Tsurugi;Haha, well about that{tgm}...
expression;Kai;Smile,CloseEyes
speak;Kai;{tgm}...{tgm} I see.|{c:e;Kai;NormalBlink,NoSmile}Maybe I should accompany you. Just to make sure you don't get lost.

expression;Tsurugi;Smile
speak;Tsurugi;Oh, Mister Kai, thank you!
speak;Kai;That book looked rather interesting.|A collection of Merinese folktales, was it?
speak;Tsurugi;Yes! There's one folktale in here that's an absolute favorite of mine.|It's commonly called "The Crane's Gift". Have you heard of it?
expression;Kai;NoSmile,CloseEyes
speak;Kai;Hm{tgm}...{tgm} Possibly.|{c:e;Kai;NormalBlink}Is it the one where a farmer nurses an injured crane back to health and|the crane transforms into a beautiful woman?
speak;Tsurugi;Yup, that's it!|I know that some versions of the tale have it so that the crane gives|the farmer expensive cloth made from her feathers in exchange for his kind gesture,|but I'd say my favorite iteration is when the crane marries the farmer.|It's quite romantic.
expression;Kai;Smile
speak;Kai;Heh, into the sappy stuff, aren't ya, Tsurugi?
expression;Tsurugi;NoSmile
speak;Tsurugi;"Sappy"?!|{c:e;Tsurugi;CloseEyes}I mean, you're not wrong, I suppose.|{c:e;Tsurugi;HalfCloseEyes}But, there's more to it than that.
speak;Kai;Oh? What, you wanna have a crane for a wife?

speak;Tsurugi;Mister Kai, please stop twisting my words!|{c:e;Tsurugi;NormalBlink}And it's not that, it's more like--

expression;Tsurugi;CloseEyes
speak;Tsurugi;Oh no no no I shouldn't have let my mouth run like that!|Why do you have this effect on me?{c:e;Tsurugi;HalfCloseEyes}If we keep up this conversation, I might end up saying that we--

Kai: You okay, Tsurugi?
Tsurugi: Y-Yes. Thank you, Mister Kai. If you weren’t here, I…
Kai: Don’t even worry about it. I’m a mercenary by trade. It’s what I do.
Tsurugi: I know, but I can defend myself. Really, I swear! I-I just… got scared.
Kai: Hey. Don’t feel like you have to push yourself. I'm gonna be here for you, Tsurugi.
Tsurugi: Mister Kai, thank you, but… 
Kai: Hm?
Tsurugi: N-Never mind. I almost let my mouth run again.
Kai: Heh. You know, I COULD figure out what you're hiding, but I like seeing you get flustered from almost spilling the beans.
Tsurugi: H-Huh?!
Kai: Yeah, like that.
Tsurugi: I… You… Mister Kai, please!

speak;Tsurugi;What do you mean, "and"?|Aren't you at least upset that I hid that from you?
speak;Kai;Not particularly.|It's understandable why you wouldn't want that fact out in the open.|{c:e;Kai;Smile}If anything, it makes me curious about something.
expression;Tsurugi;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Tsurugi;No offense, Mister Kai, but you're always curious about something.
expression;Kai;CloseEyes,Smile
speak;Kai;Heh, fair enough.|{c:e;Kai;NormalBlink,NoSmile}But as I was saying, I started thinking about that one folktale. "The Crane's Gift".|Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I assume you like it so much because|you experienced something similar to the story, didn't you?
expression;Tsurugi;CloseEyes,Smile
speak;Tsurugi;Right you are, Mister Kai. That's exactly it.
expression;Kai;CloseEyes,Smile
speak;Kai;So close to living out an actual fairy tale, aren't you, Tsurugi?
expression;Tsurugi;HalfCloseEyes,NoSmile
speak;Tsurugi;Oh come on, don't tease me like that{tgm}...
expression;Kai;NormalBlink,Smile
speak;Kai;Sorry, sorry.|But seriously, I gotta ask: who was the "farmer" who helped you?
expression;Tsurugi;NormalBlink
speak;Tsurugi;It{tgm}...{tgm} It was you, Mister Kai.
expression;Kai;NoSmile
bop_portrait;Kai
speak;Kai;I'm sorry, what?
speak;Tsurugi;It was a few years ago, but considering what form I was in,|I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't realize it was me.
speak;Kai;"Your form," huh{tgm}...?{tgm}|{c:e;Kai;CloseEyes}You know, now that you mention it,|I do remember there being a crane with|a broken wing resting in the castle garden by the pond{tgm}...{tgm}|{c:e;Kai;NormalBlink}You're saying that was you this entire time?
speak;Tsurugi;Yes. I wanted to repay you back then, but I had to hurry back home before I could.|{c:e;Tsurugi;Smile}And now, I finally get to see you again.|You're still as kind as I remember, Mister Kai.
expression;Kai;CloseEyes,Smile
speak;Kai;Heh, seems like every part of my past is catching up to me. Even this.{c:e;Kai;HalfCloseEyes,Smile}I guess this is what I get for running away from it.
