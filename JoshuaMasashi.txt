Joshua-Masashi:
??? “Hold my boisterous comrade! Would you not spare me a moment of your time?
Joshua “Who are you?”
??? “So glad you asked. I, my good man, am Masashi!”
Joshua “Nice meeting you sushi, what do you want?”
Masashi “It’s Masashi!!!! Not Sushi.”
Joshua “Yeah, yeah. Thanks Salami, now what do you want?”
Masashi “Have you ever had aquaintences of the fairer sex?”
Joshua “Are you asking if I’ve ever talked to or met a woman before?”
Masashi “Precisely! Straight to the point I like it, straight as an arrow in fact.”
Joshua “Arrows aren’t straight, they wiggle and wobble.”
Masashi “Figure of speech Figure of speech.”
Joshua “Ok assbutt, why are you asking?”
Masashi “It’s Masashi!!!! I was thinking one such as you might introduce me to the ladies you’ve met. I’m sure an arena performer such as yourself drew quite the crowd. Surely many ladies came to view your performance!”
Joshua “Sure did. Tell you what later today I’ll introduce you to some women I know.”
Masashi “I knew you’d come to reason. Thank you sir!” (Masashi you’re in now!!!! Now to swoon some elegant, high class ladies!)
Later……..
Joshua “This here’s Thundra she helps throw out the riff raff, oh and that’s Selena she helps with negotiations and bets, and this is Sigrun (They’re all big and buff and rough looking)
Masashi “Whaaaa??? Er, nice to meet you………lovely………lad…..maidens” (Why does this keep happening to me.”
One of the women “You’re cute for a shorty with no muscle”
Another one “Yeah I wouldn’t mind adopting him
??? “What’s his name
Masashi “ Masash
Joshua “This is Sushi”

Masashi and Joshua:
Hot buff girl in bikini armor approaches Masash:
“Hey handsome how about a nice, relaxing lunch? Maybe even some…….personal time afterwards?”
Masashi “Uhhhhhh………that is a most…….generous offer ma’am but I’m……..rather tied up right now.”
Buff girl is joined by two others
“Oh? What has you so preoccupied?”
Masashi “I….er………promised her highness Krista I’d help her with her archery training. Yup! In fact I’m running late so if you’ll excuse me.’
Buff Girl “Such a shame, we’ll be waiting for you then and we can have dinner instead.”
Masashi “Not necessary. I hate to trouble you lovely…….ladies and make you wait on poor me.”
Buff girl “Not a trouble at all, handsome. In fact the pleasure is all ours. We’ll be waiting and looking forward to when you’re done.”
Masashi “Of course, as you wish my ladies.” Masashi leaves. “Gods! What am I to do? Ever since that time with Joshua I can’t get them off of my back! What did I do to deserve this? I didn’t sign up for THIS! Those women are not the kind of girl I want! No refinement! Wait! Maybe Joshua can help, Masashi my boy you’re a GENIUS!” Masashi runs off
Masashi “How are you this fine, wonderful day my good sir?”
Joshua “What do you want Sushi?”
Masashi “It’s Masashi but since you asked you seem like you have a way with women.”
Joshua “Do I?”
Masashi “Absolutely, why I’m sure you have whole armies of women wanting your attention.” (I really hope he buys that lie and doesn’t call me out on it there’s no way women find him appealing)
Joshua “Just what is it you want Masashi? Out with it, oh and don’t lie to me again it puts me in a bad mood”
Masashi “Of course you see……..there’s these women who keep following me around wanting me to accompany them to dinner.
Joshua “That’s a problem? For you? The skirt chaser?
Masashi “SKIRT CHASER??? ME???? A SKIRT CHASER! Sir I’ll have you know I am merely an admirer of the feminine form, a connoisseur if you will not a brash SKIRT CHASER!”
Joshua “Whatever helps you sleep at night Sushi.”
Masashi “Would you mind……convincing them to leave me alone? Please?”
Joshua “Eh why not I’m not doing anything else, where are they?

 They said they would wait for me I claimed I’d be training her highness in archery.
Joshua “you might want to actually do that, if they find out you lied to them it could be bad for you.
Masashi “Of course! (gulp WHY ME????WHY!!! And why is it always the muscle oafs who get the girls?)
Joshua “I’ll take care of them for you
Masashi “Thank you sir, I am in your debt (now to convince Krista to an archery lesson no strings attached)
