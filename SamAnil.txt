Anil: ? !!
(Anil leaves the scene.)
Sam: What the--?! Hey, come back!
(Scene transitions to the castle gardens.)
Sam: *huff* *huff* Anil, where are you?! Krista needs you for something! Man, not here either... Anil!!
(Sam leaves the scene, and Anil enters.)
Anil: ...
Anil, thinking: Whose bright idea was it to recruit the Prowling Tiger into this army? Oh, Oreg, he's even bigger than the rumors say...
(Sam re-enters the scene.)
Sam: Found you!
Anil: !!!

Sam: Get back here, you!!

Sam: Anil, we need to talk. Er. Sign. Or, uh... Look, you know what I mean!
Anil: [Nope.]
Sam: What do you mean "nope"?! Look, I just wanna know why you've been avoiding me.
Anil: [There is no way I'm going to get along with the Prowling Tiger.]
Sam: Uh, the prowling what now?
Anil: [The Prowling Tiger! The infamous mercenary who's been killing bandits up and down southern Oregot.]
Sam: Alright, hold it, hold it, hold it! I have SO many questions. First off, people have heard about me? They have a NICKNAME for me??
Anil: [What did you expect? You've taken out thousands of bandit camps the last five years at least!]
Sam: Hundreds? Maybe. But THOUSANDS? Someone out there's exaggerating things. And what was that about being a mercenary? Sure, there was some mercenaries who taught me stuff, but that was it.
Anil: [So you at least admit to killing a mass number of bandits?]
Sam: Yeah, but it's not like I wanted to be famous for it. I had my own reasons for doing what I had to do.
Anil: [Like what? Money? Enacting justice?]
Sam: Protecting someone.
Anil: ?
Sam: Bandits kidnapped Krista years ago. I couldn't let that happen ever again.
Anil: ...
Sam: Not just her either. Everyone I love will not get hurt by bandits again. Not on my watch.
Anil: [Just be thankful you didn't make your way up north. Because if you pulled the same thing there,] [you'd have bandits out for vengeance against you too. And one of those bandits could've been me.]
Sam: What?
Anil: [We're done here. Bye.]
(Anil leaves the scene.)
Sam: Now, hold on! ... So, he used to be a bandit, huh?
