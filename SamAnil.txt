speak;Sam;Anil, we need to talk.|{c:e;Sam;HalfCloseEyes}Er. Sign. Or, uh{tgm}...{tgm}|{c:e;Sam;NormalBlink}Look, you know what I mean!
speak;Anil;[Nope.]
expression;Sam;NormalBlink
speak;Sam;What do you mean "nope"?!|Look, I just wanna know why you've been avoiding me.
speak;Anil;[There is no way I'm going to get along with the Prowling Tiger.]
speak;Sam;Uh, the prowling what now?
speak;Anil;[The Prowling Tiger!]|[The infamous mercenary who's been killing bandits up and down southern Oregot.]
speak;Sam;Alright, hold it, hold it, hold it!|I have SO many questions.|First off, people have heard about me?|They have a NICKNAME for me??
speak;Anil;[What did you expect?]|[You've taken out thousands of bandit camps the last five years at least!]
speak;Sam;Hundreds? Maybe. But THOUSANDS?|Someone out there's exaggerating things.|And what was that about being a mercenary?|Sure, there was some mercenaries who taught me stuff, but that was it.
speak;Anil;[So you at least admit to killing a mass number of bandits?]
speak;Sam;Yeah, but it's not like I wanted to be famous for it.|I had my own reasons for doing what I had to do.
speak;Anil;[Like what?]|[Money? Enacting justice?]

speak;Sam;Not just her either.|Everyone I love will not get hurt by bandits again.|{c:e;Sam;HalfCloseEyes}Not on my watch.
speak;Anil;[Just be thankful you didn't make your way up north.]|[Because if you pulled the same thing there,]|[you'd have bandits out for vengeance against you too.]|{c:e;Anil;HalfCloseEyes}[And one of those bandits could've been me.]
