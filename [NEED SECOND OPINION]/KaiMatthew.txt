[Matthew is admittedly a weird character to work with just with the nature of what he is and where he's from. Not sure if there's anything compelling to explore here beyond "Haha FE7 references!" and CoR worldbuilding that will be explored in other supports and the main plot.]

Kai and Matthew 
Kai: “Hey you!
Matthew: Who me?
Kai: Yes you. You’re not from around here are you?
Matthew: Not exactly, why do you ask?
Kai: I tend to keep tabs on things and have quite the network of intel so I know you’re not native to Medea and I’m damn sure you’re not from Merinas either. So where are you from?
Matthew: Not too sure myself but it’s far away from here, quite far.
Kai: Ever heard the name Circ?
Matthew: Can’t say I have? Why is that the capital of some place?
Kai: Not important.
