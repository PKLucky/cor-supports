Michael: Okay, Michael. Steady. Keep a good grip and thrust.
(Michael thrusts his lance.)
Michael: Right. Then prepare to parry.
(Michael gets into position.)
Michael: Alright. Repeat.
(Sam enters the scene.)
Sam: Hey, there! You Michael?
Michael: Wha? Huh? Who? Oh, it's you, sir. Yes, sir, that's me.
Sam: You don't need to "sir" me. Just call me Sam.
Michael: Yes. sir--Er, Sam, sir... Sam.
Sam: I was watching your lance work, and while I'm no expert, your form seems good. It's a nice, accurate reach weapon.
Michael: Yes, s... Mister Sam. Thank you.
Sam: No problem! Would you like to train? I can show you a few things that I've learned. Some things to watch out for particularly when facing an axe fighter.
Michael: I'd like that, Mister Sam. It would help.
Sam: Great! Though, your armor looks pretty defensive, so there's not as much of a worry when it comes to getting injured. Still, knowing is half the battle.
Michael, thinking: Wow, this guy is a lot friendlier than he looks! He looks like a lawless brigand but he's kind of jolly. Like Santa Claus' nephew or something.
Sam: C'mon, Michael, show me what you can do!
Michael: Coming, Mister Sam!
(The two exchange blows.)
Sam: You're pretty good for your age, Michael. However, unlike a sword or a spear where you can easily recover from a miss, an axe is a momentum weapon.
Michael: How so, Mister Sam?
Sam: If you miss a lance strike, you can retract it quickly. An axe, however, once you set it in motion, you have to follow through.
Michael: So, if I can see the path it's on, I can then tell where it will go next?
Sam: Right on! You're doing good, kid. I'll see you around.
(Sam leaves the scene.)
Michael: He's nice. Surprisingly nice.
