[Krista's kidnapping will more than likely be covered in another support. And Kai's father issues will also be more than likely covered in another support. Unless either of these characters will bring something new to the table regarding either of these backstory elements, I don't think this support chain will stay.]

Kai: Ah hello there Chell, you're looking lovely today. You're as beautiful as the day is long
Chell: Hee-hee. You didn't mean a word of that did you Kai?
Kai: Guilty as charged
Chell: Anyway what did you want?
Kai: Well seeing as you saw straight through my act I was wondering.
Chell: What do you want to know? You've been here for 5 years so I doubt there's anything I know that you don't.
Kai: So do you and Sam have you know a thing going on?
Chell: That is a private matter Kai, but maybe. Why thinking of making a move on me if not?
Kai: Nah not sure if you're my type
Chell: I. Am. Offended (mock offended)
Kai: Uh-huh sure you are, so you two know each other well?
Chell: Well we go back aways Sam used to live around here until about eight years ago
Kai: Eight years ago huh...wasn't that around when the princess got herself captured?
Chell: It was, it was also the day my parents died.
Kai: Sorry to hear that? How'd that happen?
Chell: When she was captured a rescue was mounted, well Sam went running off after them alone, I ran and told my parents and flew after him, my parents came along behind
Kai: Sounds chaotic
Chell: It was, we saved the Princess, but by the time the rest of the royal guard arrived both my parents died
Kai: Rough luck, my old man also died some years back
Chell: Oh I'm sorry that must be hard for you
Kai: Eh, not really it was his own fault for not being good enough, anyway thanks for the info Chell, talk to you again later
Chell:...Strange, he seems to harbor both resentment and respect for his father...what's up with that?
