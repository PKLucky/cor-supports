Sam: Hey.
Lin: Hi:
Sam: What’s up?
Lin: Eh, same old, same old
Sam: Nice sword you have, looks well used and cared for.
Lin: Thanks. Beth will always be my side.
Sam: Beth? Wasn’t that….
Lin: My mother’s name, yes.
Sam: I see……..what pushed you to be a mercenary? Especially alone, most usually hone their skills with a mercenary band or company
Lin: After my parents died you went off into Oregot alone, it was inspiring. I knew why you went to avenge the deaths of my mother and father. I vowed when I came of age I would do the same. I would leave and go out and kill every fucking son of a bitch even remotely connected to my parents’ killers.
Sam…….Lin
Lin Don’t you dare something like If you let hate fill your heart it will consume you vengence is not the way to go.
Sam: I wasn’t. In the first place I’m not one to talk……in the second I understand your sentiment. However you can’t do this alone. I went off alone, yes, but I didn’t stay alone. I had good teachers and trainers, mercenary veterans. They gave me training and tools to help me and keep me alive. What you want to do can’t be done alone, find people you can rely on to have your back no matter what to aid you.

Sam Lin A:
Lin: Thanks for training with me again Sam, it helps. Helps keep my temper in check.
Sam: Glad to help, you’re a good challenge for me, you’ve helped push my own skills so I’d call it a win-win for both of us.
Lin. Thanks….also…..
Sam: Yeah? What is it.
Lin thanks for not pushing me to…..talk to her.
Sam: Chell?
Lin: Yeah, despite the closeness you two have you never pushed me to talk to her, thanks for that.
Sam: There’s a time for everything you weren’t ready for that conversation, but now that you’ve brought it up. She worries about you, she misses you whether you live in medea or elsewhere doesn’t matter but you and Viola are the only family she has left. I would recommend talking to her and just letting her know you’re happy in your mercenary life.
Lin: …..yeah,.....not yet but perhaps I will soon. Thanks Sam
Sam: Of course.
