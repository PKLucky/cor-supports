Michael: Um, Aqua?
Aqua: Oh, Michael! Did you need something?
Michael: I wanted to apologize for the other day. What I said was really out of line.
Aqua: It's okay, really! In fact, I wanted to discuss that with you. Let's talk this out.
Michael: Oh, er, alright.

Michael: I just don't know what to think anymore, Aqua. The Holy Knights are supposed to carry out the Great Folia's will and protect his children. But that wasn't happening at all! I realize not all the Knights acted like what you all saw in Windbrook, but the fact they exist… Where's the faith? Where's the belief in the Great Folia's teachings? Where is the Great Folia when you need him…?
Aqua: Michael…
Michael: *sniff* I-I'm sorry, Aqua. This is a lot for me to handle.
Aqua: There's no need to apologize. Having your faith shaken like this is a terrible experience.
