Aqua: And may the Great Folia bless those who walked this path on days gone by, and through time forever passing.
Michael: ...
Aqua: Oh, Michael! I didn't realize you were standing there. If you wanted to pray alongside me, you could have asked.
Michael: It's okay, Aqua. I just... Well, uh, it's not like I didn't want to pray, but... I wanted to ask you something.
Aqua: What is it?
Michael: Please don't be offended, but how can you keep worshipping the Great Folia like this?
Aqua: H-Huh?
Michael: I'm sorry! That was really rude, wasn't it?
Aqua: Well--
Michael: You know what, I'll just go. Sorry!
(Michael leaves the scene.)
Aqua: W-Wait! ... Just what did the Holy Knights do to you, Michael?

Michael: Um, Aqua?
Aqua: Oh, Michael! Did you need something?
Michael: I wanted to apologize for the other day. What I said was really out of line.
Aqua: It's okay, really! In fact, I wanted to discuss that with you. Let's talk this out.
Michael: Oh, er, alright.

Michael: I just don't know what to think anymore, Aqua. The Holy Knights are supposed to carry out the Great Folia's will and protect his children. But that wasn't happening at all! I realize not all the Knights acted like what you all saw in Windbrook, but the fact they exist... Where's the faith? Where's the belief in the Great Folia's teachings? Where is the Great Folia when you need him...?
Aqua: Michael...
Michael: *sniff* I-I'm sorry, Aqua. This is a lot for me to handle.
Aqua: There's no need to apologize. Having your faith shaken like this is a terrible experience.
