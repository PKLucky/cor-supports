Joshua: Hyah! Huah! You'll go down sooner or later, George!
Alex: Joshua's opponent is quite large and heavily armored. ... Oh dear. That looked like it hurt, and he's already bleeding as it is. Why did I think coming here was a good idea again? Oh thank Medea, looks like there's an intermission. Maybe I can check on Joshua.
(Scene transitions to the medical bay of the arena.)
Alex: Joshua? Are you alright?
Joshua: Who? Oh, hello, Alex. Yeah, I'm alright. Just a couple scratches.
Alex: Good to hear. I was concerned. That blow looked ba--Joshua!
Joshua: What?
Alex: This is NOT just a scratch! You are bleeding profusely from several lacerations. And look at all of these contusions!
Joshua: Eh? Sorry, I didn't understand a word you just said.
Alex: *sigh* You have big boo-boo. Big boo-boo bleed lots.
Joshua: Alex, I may be losing blood, but the ol' thinker can still know words good.
Alex: Joshua.
Joshua: Just patch it up to stop the bleeding. Get some rags and cloth on there, and I'll be good to go!
Alex: Oh no, you don't! That would make things worse. You are going to sit there while I wash and sanitize those wounds. You need stitches, mister! 
Joshua: Can't you just wrap some bandages? The next round starts in two minutes!
Alex: Too bad. You'll have to miss it.
Joshua, thinking: Why is she smiling? I don't like this...
(Some time later...)
Joshua: Whoa, whoa, whoa! You're going to stick a needle and thread in me? All those weird herbs and liquids was one thing, but this too?!
Alex: Yes, I need to stitch the wounds up. And those herbs and liquids were cleaning the wounds.
Joshua: You're going to stick a NEEDLE in me?
Alex: Again, yes. Don't tell me you're afraid of a little needle and thread.
Joshua: I never said that.
Alex: So, it's okay, then? Good to know.
Joshua: I NEVER SAID THAT EITHER!
