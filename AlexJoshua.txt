Alex: Hello, Joshua. I didn't expect to see you here in the library.
Joshua: Hey there, Alex. Figured I'd unwind after training by doing some reading.
Alex: I never would have taken you for a reader Joshua. You come off as more... abrasive, honestly.
[IF Taylor is still alive:]
Alex: A lot like Taylor, actually. And getting HIM to read anything is like getting a child to eat their greens.

Joshua: You gotta keep your mind sharp if you want to survive in the arena. Both mind and body need to be strong.

Alex: I can agree with that sentiment. On that note, what do you like to read usually? Maybe I can make some recommendations? While not an expert on what the library contains, I do know how the books are organized.
Joshua: That would be very helpful. Maybe books with legends about different dragon slayers. Especially those where a sword is used in the slaying.
Alex: Ah, you like dragon-slaying tales I take it?
Joshua: They’re fun to read, besides what’s more formidable than a dragon?

Alex: I can agree with that sentiment. Though, I fear it's my mind that's more strong than my body.
Joshua: Don't sell yourself short, Alex. You strike me as a strong, capable woman. However, if you want some help, these books might do the trick. I'll leave them with you.
Alex: Why, thank you, Joshua.
Joshua: No problem. I'll catch you later. Reading makes me hungry.
(Joshua leaves the scene.)
Alex: What a strange man. What are these books? "10 Lifts for Life", "Meat Makes Muscle", and "Train Like a Champion, Be a Champion"... These aren't something I normally read, but they seem interesting.

Joshua: Hyah! Huah! You'll go down sooner or later, George!
Alex: Joshua's opponent is quite large and heavily armored. ... Oh dear. That looked like it hurt, and he's already bleeding as it is. Why did I think coming here was a good idea again? Oh thank Medea, looks like there's an intermission. Maybe I can check on Joshua.
(Scene transitions to the medical bay of the arena.)
Joshua: Heh, he's a tough one alright.
Alex: Joshua? Are you alright?
Joshua: Who? Oh, hello, Alex. Yeah, I'm alright. Just a couple scratches.
Alex: Good to hear. I was concerned. That blow looked ba--Joshua!
Joshua: What?
Alex: This is NOT just a scratch! You are bleeding profusely from several lacerations. And look at all of these contusions!
Joshua: Eh? Sorry, I didn't understand a word you just said.
Alex: *sigh* You have big boo-boo. Big boo-boo bleed lots.
Joshua: Alex, I may be losing blood, but the ol' thinker can still know words good.
Alex: Joshua.
Joshua: Just patch it up to stop the bleeding. Get some rags and cloth on there, and I'll be good to go!
Alex: Oh no, you don't!
Joshua: What? That would work, right?
Alex: No, that would make things worse. You are going to sit there while I wash and sanitize those wounds. You need stitches, mister! 
Joshua: Can't you just wrap some bandages?
Alex: I could, but I'm not going to. Don't worry. You're in good hands.
Joshua: The next round starts in two minutes!
Alex: Too bad. You'll have to miss it.
Joshua, thinking: Why is she smiling? I don't like this...
Joshua: Alex are all those herbs really necessary?
Alex: Yes. Now take that shirt off
Joshua: What for?
Alex: Well, I can't wash your wounds with your shirt still on, can I?
(Some time later...)
Joshua: You're going to stick a needle and thread in me?
Alex: Yes, I need to stitch the wounds up. I've already cleaned them, so they should heal well. The salves I applied will help too.
Joshua: You're.... going to stick a NEEDLE in me?
Alex: Again, yes. Don't tell me you're afraid of a little needle and thread.
Joshua: I never said that.
Alex: So, it's okay, then? Good to know.
Joshua: I NEVER SAID THAT EITHER!
