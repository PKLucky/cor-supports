Alex: Hello, Joshua. I didn't expect to see you here in the library.
Joshua: Hey there, Alex. Figured I'd unwind after training by doing some reading.
Alex: I never would have taken you for a reader Joshua. You come off as more... abrasive, honestly.
[IF Taylor is still alive:]
Alex: A lot like Taylor, actually. And getting HIM to read anything is like getting a child to eat their greens.
[END]
Joshua: You gotta keep your mind sharp if you want to survive in the arena. Both mind and body need to be strong.

Alex: I can agree with that sentiment. On that note, what do you like to read usually? Maybe I can make some recommendations? While not an expert on what the library contains, I do know how the books are organized.
Joshua: That would be very helpful. Maybe books with legends about different dragon slayers. Especially those where a sword is used in the slaying.
Alex: Ah, you like dragon-slaying tales I take it?
Joshua: They’re fun to read, besides what’s more formidable than a dragon?

Alex: I can agree with that sentiment. Though, I fear it's my mind that's more strong than my body.
Joshua: Don't sell yourself short, Alex. You strike me as a strong, capable woman. However, if you want some help, these books might do the trick. I'll leave them with you.
Alex: Why, thank you, Joshua.
Joshua: No problem. I'll catch you later. Reading makes me hungry.
(Joshua leaves the scene.)
Alex: What a strange man. What are these books? "10 Lifts for Life", "Meat Makes Muscle", and "Train Like a Champion, Be a Champion"... These aren't something I normally read, but they seem interesting.

Joshua- Hyah! Huah! You'll go down sooner or later George!
Alex- Hmm, Joshua's opponent is quite large and heavily armored...oh dear. That looked like it hurt and he's already bleeding as it is. Why did I think coming here was a good idea again. Oh thank Medea looks like it's an intermission of sorts maybe I can check on Joshua
Joshua Heh, he's a tough one alright.
??? Joshua? Are you alright?
Joshua Who? Oh hello Alex yes I'm alright just a couple scratches
Alex Good to hear I was concerned that blow looked ba....JOSHUA!
Joshua What?
Alex This is NOT just a scratch, you are bleeding profusely from several lacerations, you have a few nasty contusions.
Joshua Eh? Sorry I'm not a medic Alex what was all that.
Alex Sigh. You have big boo-boo, big boo-boo bleed lots.
Joshua So? Just patch it up to stop the bleeding. Some rags and cloth and I'll be good to go
Alex: Oh no you don't!
Joshua: What? That would work right?
Alex: That's not how that works. You are going to sit there while I wash and sanitize those wounds, you need stitches mister! 
Joshua: Can't you just wrap some bandages?
Alex: I could...but I'm not going to. Don't worry you're in good hands.
Joshua: The next round starts in two minutes!
Alex: Too bad, you'll have to miss it.
Joshua: Why is she smiling? I don't like this....Alex are all those herbs really necessary?
Alex: Yes. Time Passes
Joshua: You're going to stick a needle and thread in me?
Alex: Yes I need to stitch the wounds up, I've cleaned your wounds so they should heal well also the salves I applied will help as well.
Joshua: You're....going to stick a NEEDLE in me?
Alex: Yes, don't tell me you're afraid of a little needle and thread.
Joshua: I never said that.
Alex: So it's ok then? Good to know
Joshua: I NEVER SAID THAT EITHER!
