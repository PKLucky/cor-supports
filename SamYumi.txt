Yumi: Oh, hello big guy~ You look handsome and strong. Very strong. So very strong.
Sam: Laying it on kind of thick, aren't you?
Yumi: ... Interesting.
Sam: What?
Yumi: Usually, guys take one look at me and they're head over heels over me.
Sam: Why? You're pretty to look at, yeah. But why do most guys go stupid when they see you?
Yumi: Uh? Why do you think?
Sam: I dunno.
Yumi: I'll give you a hint.
(Gestures to her chest.)
Sam: I'm not following.
Yumi: These? My boobies? My massive fu--
Sam: Wait, wait, wait, back up. What in the world are "boobies"?
(A buff girl walks by.)
Sam: Whoa! Did you see her?
Yumi: Yeah? She someone important?
Sam: I dunno, but did you see her arms? And those legs! Oh, looks like she's going to the arena. Talk later!
(Sam rushes off)
Yumi: Huh, strange. He didn't ask me out or anything. On top of that, how in the world does he NOT know what boobies are? BOOBIES! For crying out loud, every red-blooded man knows what boobies are. Wait. He left me! Oh no, you don't! You're not getting away that easily, mister!
(Yumi rushes in the direction Sam went.)

Sam: Huh? Where'd she go?
Yumi: There you are! Found you!
Sam: Oh hey? Who were you again?
Yumi: The name is Yumi
Sam: Oh ok, mind helping me find that girl?
Yumi: Now hold up mister!
Sam: What? Something wrong?
Yumi: Yes actually!
Sam: What then?
Yumi: we gotta talk 
Sam: About?
Yumi: About my boobies!
Sam: We need to talk..about your boobies?
Yumi: Yes! Well, no. Kind of? It's complicated.
Sam: I'm not following. What are boobies anyway
Yumi: See that's the first issue. How do you not know what boobies are? Boobies! Everyone loves boobies!
Sam: And what are they?
Yumi: Uh-hello? Here. No down here, lower...beneath my face..a bit lower. There. These are boobies
Sam: They are nice to look at
Yumi: Oh thank gods
Sam: What?
Yumi: I thought you were some infedel or something or you had something wrong in the head
Sam: Like I said before, you are pretty I personally don't get the appeal.
Yumi: And WHY not? I'm kind of famous around arenas
Sam: You're too skinny
Yumi: Huh? My figure is perfectly fine thank you very much
Sam: You got no muscle on you
Yumi: I beg your pardon? Who in their right mind wants a girl with muscle? It's so unseemly
Sam: If you were in the mercenary company I was part of some years back you would be deligated to kitchen duties and laundry that would be about all you'd be good for.
Yumi: Interesting....let me get this straight. You like a girl with muscle on her?
Sam: Yeah? Doesn't everybody?
Yumi: No of course not but that's not important
Sam: They're missing out, in my old merc outfit there was this one girl who was huge. Her legs were like tree trunks
Yumi: Lovely. Back on topic and to clarify you like a girl with a lot of muscle?
Sam: Preferably yes, but it doesn't have to be extreme. I just think girls look better with some muscle on them where they don't look like a wind will blow them away. Was that all?
Yumi: Sigh..yes that's all
Sam: Ok, nice talking to you Yumi. See you later, Oh there's that girl! Got to go!
Yumi: After all the work I put in to get the body I have and then he barely glances my way. He likes muscle girls huh? Well a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do.
