speak;Forrest;Miss Marina! You startled me.|And I'm sorry, but what are you referring to?
speak;Marina;Why, your singing, of course!
speak;Forrest;My singing? I'm not being a nuisance, am I?
speak;Marina;The complete opposite, actually! You have quite the voice, Sir Forrest.|If you weren't a knight, I'm sure you would make an excellent bard.
speak;Forrest;Thank you? I'm not sure how to take that.
expression;Marina;Smile
speak;Marina;Take it as a compliment, dear.|{c:e;Marina;NoSmile}Trust me, if this knight business goes south, you have nothing to worry about.|You have your charming voice to fall back on.|{c:e;Marina;HalfCloseEyes,Smile}Though, even if you didn't have the gift of song,|your handsome face could get you far in other lines of work.

speak;Forrest;Alright.
speak;Marina;Why don't you stay here and relax for a little while?|You must be busy, but a few minutes of rest won't hurt, I'm sure.

speak;Forrest;How fitting.
expression;Marina;Smile
speak;Marina;Indeed.|Its lyrics speak of the moon's beauty as it's reflected upon Lake Lunaris's surface.|I could teach it to you, if you'd like.
expression;Forrest;NoSmile
speak;Forrest;Oh, are you sure?
speak;Marina;Absolutely. I wasn't lying the other day when I said you had a good voice.|Honestly, I just want to hear you at least attempt to sing it.
speak;Forrest;Well, if you insist.|{c:e;Forrest;Smile}I'll do my best, Miss Marina.

Marina: When I was a little girl, I dreamed of getting swept off my feet by a dashing young knight. I never thought that would have actually happened to me.
Forrest: “Dashing,” you say? You flatter me too much, Miss Marina.
Marina: Oh, enough of the formalities. We have gone past that, wouldn’t you say?
Forrest: I suppose.
Marina: But back to the matter at hand, I already told you how handsome you are. And with a face like that, it makes me wonder if there's a body to match.
Forrest: P-Pardon?
Marina: You always looked so gallant and strong when riding across the battlefield. Just what could be beneath all that armor, hm?
Forrest: M-Marina, I…
Marina: Yes?
Forrest: This, er, doesn’t seem like a proper conversation to have–
Marina: We’ve had worse. Remember how I said you could do other lines of work?
Forrest: I'd much rather forget.
Marina: I do still think that, you know. In fact, I wouldn't mind if we did it for free.
Forrest: Wh-What?! I… Erm… W-Well– I apologize, Marina. I-I just remembered Her Highness needed me for… Um… S-Sorry, goodbye!
(Forrest leaves)
Marina: Still a shy boy, I see. He'll come around eventually.
