Chell: Ah Captain Taylor off to the pub again?
Taylor: Well no for once actually I was about to give Forrest a report on how the new recruits are shaping up. But now that you mention it that sounds like an EXCELLENT idea. Wanna join me?
Chell: Heh, heh. Some other time perhaps just behave yourself
Taylor: When have I ever gotten carried away I can handle my alchohol just fine I'll have you know!
Chell: Oh? No discretions when you've been drinking?
Taylor: Absolutely none at all
Chell: What about the time you proposed to Krista's mom...with her father barely two feet away
Taylor: A minor lapse in judgement
Chell: You're lucky he let you walk away with your head attached
Taylor: Speaking of heads remaining attached want to spar some?
Chell: Sure!
Taylor: What got you to pick up the axe anyway?
Chell: When I lost my parents on that fateful day, dad always had an admiration for those who use axes. It's also a cheap weapon I guess I focused on learning how to use an axe as a way to stay connected to my father...Sam also liked the axe and he left after the funeral it may have been an unconscious way to stay connected to him too but I think it's more likely the former
Taylor: Sorry I didn't mean to bring up a sensitive subject
Chell: No worries, how about you Taylor why the axe specifically?
Taylor: Honestly? I just love how an axe whistles through the air as I chop down on an enemy, also the axe is difficult to truly defend against. Even if you block you still feel the force of the impact it's almost like trying to block a hammer blow.

B?
Taylor: Ah Chell more axe training?
Chell: I could ask you the same thing
Taylor: Gotta stay on my game otherwise you might leave me behind
Chell: Pretty sure I already do that
Taylor: Well EXECUSE ME Miss I'll-Just-fly-over-the-entire-army! Not all of us can fly.
Chell: True that,still one must constantly hone their skills with any weapon but especially an axe.
Taylor: Very true indeed despite the perception most have of it wielding an axe effectively takes quite a bit of skill in some ways even more so than a spear or sword.
Chell: Hmmm....you know that may be true actually. Care to elaborate?
Taylor: Glad to so with a sword you want to stab your opponent in the torso or sever their limbs there's more of a target. An axe you're aiming for the head, the side of the body maybe trying to hook their ankle or wrist it's a much smaller target
Chell: You know....you're right I never thought about that. Why don't we swing for the torso then? The center mass?
Taylor: What if it gets stuck?
Chell: I'm not following
Taylor: Come with me
Scene change
Taylor: Ok so this axe is stuck pretty good in this training dummy, try to yank it out
Chell: Ok....hugh....huh it's really hard to get out.
Taylor: Yes what if that happened in battle
Chell:....I might be pushing up daisies as they say
Taylor: Yes, now try the other axe here in the side an axe can still get stuck in the side
Chell: Alright....oh I see while difficult I can tear down can't do that in the torso
Taylor: Right. We have smaller targets with axes but it's per the course all weapons have their advantages and shortcoming but I love that an axe has no good defense
Chell: I remember father saying that
Taylor: If you block an axe blow the force of that blow still goes through and hits your bones and joints very unpleasant
Chell: I can imagine
Taylor: The best defense against an axe is to NOT get hit not to tank it. An axe will ALWAYS hurt
Chell: You know you're surprisingly bright and intuitive Taylor
Taylor: Stop you'll make me blush, but thank you Chell it's been good talking with you
Chell: You as well Taylor

A?
Taylor: Hey Chell my favorite training partner, how about we cool things off with a refreshing drink at the tavern?
Chell: Taylor....
Taylor: Yes?
Chell....You know what sure. With everything that's going on a drink or two would be great
Taylor: See you get it! Nothing to worry about
Chell: Yeah you're right what harm could one drink or two do?
Taylor: Exactly!
Some time later
Taylor: Hey bartender! Hic! 'Ow 'bout another...hic drink for my lady friend?
Bartender? You sure? You both have been doing a lot of drinking
Chell: 'Come on Mr Drinks Man...hic we ain't had that...much to dwink...just one or two
Taylor: See? Don't say no to my lady friend now, top us off buddy
Bartender: More like one or two dozen but alright
Taylor: Did I ever mention you got HUGE boobs Chell?
Chell: Hee-hee, nooooo.....how huge?
Taylor: Really huge the biggest badonkers
Some more time later
Chell: Ugh.....my head what happened last night?
Taylor: Not so loud....head hurts a bit
Chell:....TAYLOR!
Taylor: What?
Chell: What are you doing in my bed?
Taylor: I'm in your bed? Thought it was mine.
Chell: How did we get here?
Taylor: No idea don't remember
Chell:....you wouldn't happen to remember if we....did anything would you?
Taylor: Pretty sure I'd remember that what makes you think we did?
Chell: We're in the SAME BED TAYLOR! What does that sound like we might have done?
Taylor: Had a sleepover?
Chell: I sure hope that's ALL that happened
Taylor: I'm sure that's all that did happen...where are my pants?
Chell:.... not helping our case here Taylor
