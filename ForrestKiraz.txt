Kiraz: Yeah, what do you wanna talk about?
Forrest: I'm curious about Dark Magic.
Kiraz: Okay I think I can help with that, the books are very heavy so you need real focus to use them.
Forrest: Bu-
Kiraz: The consequences for messing up or losing focus are disastrous.
Forrest: How disastrous?
Kiraz: I don't know how to describe it now but I could teach you if you want? 
Forrest: Teach me.
Kiraz: Oh-okay. (I hope I can teach good.) But first I need you to hold this. (Give Forrest a book)
Forrest: (Flinches upon book being given) Woah, you were right, this is heavy. 
Kiraz: Focus.

Kiraz: (sighs) Tell me about Nature Magic, I'm curious about how it works.
Forrest: It requires… Emotion- Not too much but in a way where you feel the Nature within you.
Kiraz: (Considering from the stuff I read and watch he must be use fire magic) Interesting, I wanna know the emotion to channel for Ice.
Forrest: I'd tell you but I don't have any Ice Magic on me.
Kiraz: Oh darn. Ice seems very interesting. Well maybe later. Say could I help you with navigation through sand maybe?
Forrest: (Come on Forrest, if you can master this than no trouble will come to h-) 
Kiraz: Sir, Sir! I'm talking to you. Can I-(sighs) (From the way things are going he'll never be able to use Ancient Magic without trouble) Sir. (Shakes him)
Forrest: Oh, sorry. I was-
Kiraz: Breathe, calm down. You clearly need your composer.
