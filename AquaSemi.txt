Semi: How're you holding up, Aqua?
Aqua: I'm doing well. Thank you for asking.
Semi: All this time tagging along with the princess hasn't taken a toll on you, has it?
Aqua: No, not at all.
Semi: You sure? You've been running across the battlefield left and right tending to everyone's wounds. Isn't that tiring you out?
Aqua: Semi, I assure you I'm fine! Was us being captured by those bandits still on your mind?
Semi: ...
Aqua: Oh, Semi... You don't have to worry so much about me. I know things have been hectic, but now we have Her Highness and the Medean royal army by our side! They can protect us.
Semi: Hmph. I trust these guys as far as I can throw 'em. Besides, even if I did actually trust them, it still wouldn't matter.
Aqua: What do you mean?
Semi: I'll be the one to protect you, Aqua. Always. That's how it's always been.
Aqua: You know that's not true--
Semi: It might as well have been.
Aqua: ...
Semi: I'm gonna do what Azure didn't do for years, Aqua. I don't care what his reasons were for leaving. He still left, and that's all that matters. I'll be there for you.
