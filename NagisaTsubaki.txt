Nagisa: Lady Tsubaki?
Tsubaki: I'm stuck. The princess of Medea comes here and it turns out my father was being controlled.
Nagisa: We'll get to the bottom of this. And she's definitely hiding something. That deserter Kai is one of her retainers now. There's something going on between them
Tsubaki: That's not true. It's just in your head. The reason he left has nothing to do with her I'm sure.
Nagisa: He still left. 
Tsubaki: But Nagisa, there are a lot of people here. It wouldn't be so bad to talk with them.
Nagisa: When this is all over they'll just leave you. 
Tsubaki: They wouldn't seem like they'd do that on purpose.
Nagisa: (sighs) You're right, Lord Samegoro probably wouldn't let you go anywhere outside of Merinas. I'm sorry Lady Tsubaki
Tsubaki: Do not worry. Let's go outside.
Nagisa: Understood.
Tsubaki: Smile.
