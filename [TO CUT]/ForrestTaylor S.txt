# Developer notes: While a fun support conversation, it ending in a romantic context felt like it came out of nowhere with how the rest of the support played out. Plus, there was no compelling way to rewrite this into a more platonic tone. (This would make for excellent fanfic fuel, though.) #

Taylor: Finally warmed up to the occasional tavern outing, huh, General?
Forrest: Hmm, not exactly. I'd say that it's more I'm enjoying my time with you, Taylor. With drinks or not.
Taylor: Ha! I'm glad to hear that. I'm really enjoying your company too. It helps that you've loosened up a bit once we got this ball rolling.
Forrest: I suppose I have.
Taylor: How about we celebrate with another round?
Forrest: An excuse for more drinks? I suppose I don't mind. Go ahead, Taylor.
Taylor: Hey, barkeep! Another round for me and my buddy here!
(Several drinks later...)
Taylor: General? You good?
Forrest: You're *hic!* a good guy, Taylor.
Taylor: Uh-huh?
Forrest: I like you a lot. *hic!*
Taylor: Well, I like you too. You're a great comrade.
Forrest: Nah, nah, it's more than that. It's wayyyy more. *hic!*
Taylor: Uh, General? I think you've had too many--
(Forrest kisses Taylor)
Taylor: Mnn?!
Forrest: I really really *hic!* like ya, Taylor.
Taylor: G-General, I'm flattered. Really, I am. But, you sure you wanna do this in public?
Forrest: Forget 'bout them.
Taylor: Yeahhhh... You know what, let's just go ba--
(Forrest hugs Taylor.)
Taylor: Ah!
Forrest: Gotchu~
Taylor: G-General...! Not in front of the ladies, come on!
Forrest: You're *hic!* cute when you blush~
Taylor: Hey, where's that hand goi--
(Forrest grabs... somewhere?)
Taylor: A-Ah?!
Taylor, thinking: Oh dear Medea, this better not awaken something in me.
