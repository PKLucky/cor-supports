(Yukino sees Masashi leaving a house)
Yukino: (Argh, it’s him.)
Masashi: Oh- hello I wasn't expecting to see you.what conditioner do you use?
Yukino: (What do I say to have him leave me alone?) First of all, that’s none of your business-
Masashi: I'm sorry, it's just that you look like someone I knew.
Yukino: Sure I do, bet I'm not the first person you've said that to.
Masashi: N-no, I really mean it. And I just want to say thank you for sparing me, I know it was because I was needed for information but still. 
Yukino: Wasn't the demand for your life, never speaking to me again? I'm thinking of withdrawing it. (moves closer to Masashi) Wanna see some sword skills?
Masashi: Uh- I want to make up for our first meeting, I-I want to kn-know more about you.
Yukino: Don't worry I'm not gonna kill you, but I'm not kidding about my sword skills.
Masashi: I-I'll show off my bow skills too.
Yukino: Oh I'd like to see them? (slightly smiling, touches him)
Masashi: I-I I’m sorry!
(Masashi leaves)
Yukino: He's interesting… I hope he's not as bad as he presents himself.
