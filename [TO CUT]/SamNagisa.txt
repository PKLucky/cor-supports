# Developer notes: Cut from the game upon request. Sam didn't remember what direction he wanted to take this support. #

C Support:
Nagisa: Watchin Sam training
Nagisa: ……...Eh-hem There is a WOMAN present mister, put a shirt on did no one teach you how to act around the fairer sex?
Sam: Not my problem. No one is making you stay and watch. Don’t like it then go away.
Nagisa: Do you realize who I am? I’m the retainer to the princess of Merines.
Sam: And that’s supposed to impress me? Now leave me alone…….woman, I’m busy
Nagisa: Are you not going to put a shirt on? Or are you just another lapdog to the floozy
Weapon clash sound
Nagisa: What the hell? That could have killed me!
Sam: Such a misfortune that would have been. Now let’s get a couple things straight you vile, harpy mouthed, wench. One I don’t take orders from anybody. No body tells me what to do. I do what I do because I want to. Not Forrest, not Taylor, not Alex, not Krista and definantly not you. Two: If you do not restrain your mouth I will kill you.
Nagisa: Suuuurrrre you will. Guys like you are all the same you act all big and tough, your bark is loud but you back down at the first sign of danger.
Sam moves closer. “You sure you want to test that theory?
Nagisa: Furthermore, the Emperor has gone to war with nations for less than you attacking me just now maybe I should report this to him.
Sam: Do it. Be my guest. Do I look like I am someone that gives a rat’s buttocks what your emperor or anyone says or thinks? 
Nagisa: Such talk could endanger the standing of Medea with Merinas
Sam: Not my problem, what is my problem is how you talk to my friends.
And that’s rich coming from you, I’m surprised that the king hasn’t waged war on Merineas for how you keep talking about the princess. Heir to the throne. His daughter. Now get out of my sight I’m busy training and talking to you is a waste of breath and of my time.
Nagisa Leaves. 
Sam: ……..stupid woman.
Nagisa: That man…..is insufferable. I’ll have to keep the princess away from him one wrong word and he might kill her.
