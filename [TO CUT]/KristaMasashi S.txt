# Developer notes: This is what happens when my shipper brain can't keep its impulses in check lol Still, it's a sweet S Support, but the conversations prior to this did not leave enough room for romance to bloom. On top of that, there wasn't enough substance here to make it an A+ support. #

Krista: So, what're your plans after this whole conflict is over? Going back to Merinas?
Masashi: Yes. I would imagine Emperor Samegoro will be back to his old self, so I'm sure serving under him would be no problem.
Krista: Yeah, makes sense.
(Masashi fires an arrow.)
Krista: Nice bullseye.
Masashi: Why, thank you, Your Highness.
Krista: Aw, you can drop the formalities, Masashi. Just call me Krista.
Masashi: Oh, er, are you sure?
Krista: I don't see why not. We're friends, right?
Masashi: Friends... Yes, I suppose so. I find it hard to believe we've gotten so close, considering our rather... unfavorable first meeting.
Krista: Heh, funny how things worked out.
(Krista fires an arrow.)
Krista: Another one on the mark. Not a bad round, Masashi.
Masashi: Thank you, Yo--I mean, Krista.
Krista: You'll get used to it. Anyway, want me to help you get your arrows?
Masashi: That would be kind of you, Krista. Thank you.
(Further down the archery range...)
Krista: Hm... This one's stuck in here pretty good. Mind giving me a hand?
Masashi: Of course. Let me--
(Krista kisses Masashi.)
Masashi: Mm?! K-Krista, wha...?
Krista: Hehe, what? Don't tell me you've never been kissed before.
Masashi: Th-That's not--I just... I don't like being kissed.
Krista: Hm...? Oh, gotcha. No worries, we can take things slow. Is holding hands okay?
Masashi: Yes, that's fine. But we need both hands to pull out my arrows, don't we?
Krista: Very true. Oh! What if we hold hands and use our free hands to get your arrows out?
Masashi: That sounds overly complicated and silly, but sure.
