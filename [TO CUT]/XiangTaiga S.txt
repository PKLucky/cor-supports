# Developer notes: Very silly, but ultimately the romance came out of nowhere with how the previous supports played out :( Very good fanfic material, though. #

Taiga: Hey, Xiang! Up for another game of poker?
Xiang: I always am, Taiga.
Taiga: Awesome! And let's make this one a real high-stakes game.
Xiang: Er, what does that entail exactly?
Taiga: If I win, then you gotta marry me. If you win, I gotta marry you!
Xiang: ... Wait. Doesn't that mean--
Taiga: Don't think about it too hard! Come on, I'll get the deck shuffled then we can start. Best three hands out of five.
Xiang: *sigh* Alright, alright.
(A few games of poker later...)
Taiga: And that's another loss for me. Looks like you win my hand in marriage, Xiang.
Xiang: Well-played, Taiga.
Taiga: Wanna know the best part? I got a ring ready right here! So you don't have to worry about getting one yourself.
Xiang: So, you were planning on winning?
Taiga: That was the idea, yeah. But since you won, you gotta do it.
Xiang: You sound so disappointed.
Taiga: Of course I am! I gotta be the one married to you, not the other way around...
Xiang: ... Taiga.
Taiga: Yeah?
Xiang: Could you please repeat the stakes of the game for me one more time?
Taiga: If I win, you marry me, and if you win, I marry you.
Xiang: Now, just... Think about what you just said.
Taiga: ... Oh. .... OH. OH!! I WON A WIFE!
Xiang: There we go.
