Celeste: Hoo-ya! Take that, meanie! Now, stay down, stupid bandit! Ya! Celeste wins again!
(Sam enters the scene.)
Sam: Hey, kid! Training your axe skills again?
Celeste: Hey, mister! Yeah, I gotta get stronger! Need to do my best and to keep my friends safe.
Sam: Good for you. You like axes, it seems.
Celeste: Yeah, axes are the best! Who wants a boring old sword anyway? I can chop wood with this if I need to! When was the last time a swordfighter chopped up wood with a sword?
Sam: Yeah, axes are really cool. They're also fun to swing through the air.
Celeste: I know, right? Whoosh, whoosh! They're so cool! I tried to get  Michael to use an axe, but he just sticks to his lance. I never really got the appeal.
Sam: The spear is a good weapon, though. I don't use one myself, but yes, axes are great. What got you to use axes in the first place?
Celeste: My mom. This was her axe. She was the one who taught me and Michael how to use our respective weapons in the first place.
Sam: I see.
Celeste: Yeah. That's why I'm going to be the best axe swinger around one day! They'll sing songs about Celeste the Invincible! And her trusty sidekick Michael.
Sam: I look forward to it. Keep improving, kiddo!
Celeste: Thanks, mister. You too!
(Sam leaves the scene.)
Celeste: Okay, you bandit, now where were we?
