Masashi: Alright, so I could either go for the target or the apple, but that's not good enough, I can't let everything distract me. I'll get both.
(Gets both the apple and bullseye)
Masashi: Perfect! Yes! I go-
(Yukino appears from behind a tree)
Yukino: I was wondering where the training dummy was.
Masashi: O-Oh sorry, I-I I didn't know it belonged to you. Also sorry about everything else.
Yukino: Don't worry, I'll just see what more you can do.
Masashi: A-alright so, I use targets most of time but I prefer apples, they're smaller so you have a better idea on how accurate you are... At least if it's not windy.
Yukino: Different from sword practice, we use Wooden Sword, they may break easier but they are good reserving strong swords (I imagine this situation like Opera rehersals where they don't fully sing in order to reserve their voice for the full 7 shows a week). Fire another shot
Masashi: Okay, th-thank you. Could I a-also place the apple on the d-dummy?
Yukino: Sure.
(A few minutes later)
Yukino: It comes down to this, it's slightly windy right now so are you sure you can do this?
Masashi: I think I've got this.
(Masashi gets another apple bullseye)
Yukino: Such accuracy.
Masashi: Alright! Could I see how you do your training?
Yukino: Sure
(moves around, swinging at Masashiâ€™s weak points but not actually hitting him).
Yukino: I think I prefer living targets because we also practice not killing our opponents, that's another reason we use Wooden Swords.
Masashi(Very scared but very impressed too): That was so e-e-e-Elegant! You even went after my weak points! Could you show me more later if you can please?
Yukino: Sure, just get yourself a sword.
