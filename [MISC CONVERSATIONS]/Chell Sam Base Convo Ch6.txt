Sam: It's good to see you again Chell...it's been
Chell: A long time?
Sam: Yeah. Well it's getting late, I'll see you in the morning and we can catch up more
Chell: Where are you going Sam and why are you heading into the woods?
Sam: To find a place to sleep. Just need a wide enough tree and I'll be fine
Chell: Oh no you don't.
Sam: Huh?
Chell: You are NOT just sleeping outside like some wild animal
Sam: I've done it before though...
Chell: That's neither here nor there. You're coming with me (drags Sam off) Here, we can share my tent. Isn't this better than outside?
Sam: Yeah. It is...thanks Chell
Chell: You're welcome (stupid men), uh Sam?
Sam: Yeah?
Chell: It's getting late
Sam: Yeah it is
Chell: And we should probably get out of our armor...
Sam: I don't wear armor and these pants are comfortable
Chell: Well I do
Sam: Oh, yeah you do don't you?
Chell: And I would LIKE to change out of it
Sam: Oh ok go ahead
Chell:...
Chell: Sam do you mind turning around while I change?
Sam: OH! THAT's what you meant!
Chell: Yes Sam that's what I meant...unless you WANT to see me in my birthday suit?
Sam: Uhhhhhh.....turns around quickly "I'm not peeking"
Chell: Hee-hee.......ok I'm done you can turn around now, that's much more comfortable
Sam: Oh, so you have other clothes besides your armor?
Chell: Yes Sam I do...soooo does that reaction mean you DON'T want to see me in my birthday suit?
Sam: .....uhhhh...before I answer that what's the wrong answer? I feel like there's a wrong answer here.
Chell: Hee-hee. Not telling. Wink
Sam: Uh Chell? There's only one sleeping bag.
Chell: Oh? So there is, I wonder what we'll do about that problem
Sam: Yeah
Chell: I guess we have no choice but to share.
Sam: As long as you're sure
Chell: I'm very sure Sam
