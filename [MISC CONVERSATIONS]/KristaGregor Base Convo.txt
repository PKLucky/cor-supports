Krista: Pretty cool sword you got there, Gregor.
Gregor: Oh ho! Krista has good eye for weapons, yes? Is mighty blade from good friend of Gregor.
Krista: Ohhh, I see. Who's this friend of yours?
Gregor: Tactician from back home. Very smart. Very astute. Although, name she give to blade is... not so much.
Krista: Well, a great weapon like that probably has a good name. It can't be that bad!
Gregor: Is called... "Slashy Slash".
Krista: Wait, what?
Gregor: Gregor no think name is, how you say, creative. All swords can do slash, no? This sword no different!
Krista: I mean, it's descriptive in that way. You know what the weapon's supposed to do! It's like calling a lance "Stabby Stab" or an axe "Choppy Chop".
Gregor: Ha ha ha!
Krista: Wh-What's so funny?
Gregor: Ahahaha! I sorry, Krista. Is just that you and friend is sharing of mind. She also name lance "Stabby Stab" and axe "Choppy Chop".
Krista: Haha, I see. I guess we'd get along well, in that case. Oh, you can use bows, right? How about I get one for you? Maybe call it "Shooty Shoot".
Gregor: Ah, yes... "Shooty Shoot". Perfect name for weapon that does the shooting.
Krista: Exactly! You get it.
