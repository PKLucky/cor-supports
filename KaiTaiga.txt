speak;Kai;Yes? And you're Taiga, Ke--Ryuuji's crewmate, correct?
expression;Taiga;Smile
speak;Taiga;Yup! With intros outta the way, I got a huge favor to ask.
expression;Kai;Smile
speak;Kai;Might take you up on it, might not. What is it?
speak;Taiga;I heard from the captain that you're a pretty smart guy.|So, I wanna see how your smarts compete against my luck in a game of blackjack!
expression;Kai;NoSmile
speak;Kai;Oh? Sounds like you've got quite a winning streak under your belt already.
expression;Taiga;HalfCloseEyes,NoSmile
speak;Taiga;Well, uh{tgm}...{tgm} No. Not really.|{c:e;Taiga;CloseEyes}I've lost every game I've played.|{c:e;Taiga;NormalBlink,Smile}But that just means my lucky break's gonna be HUGE!|And I have a feeling that it's coming today!
expression;Kai;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Kai;{tgm}...{c:e;Kai;NormalBlink}{tgm} You know what, I've got nothing better to do. Deal me in, Taiga.

speak;Taiga;Those didn't count.
expression;Kai;CloseEyes
speak;Kai;*sigh*{c:e;Kai;NormalBlink} Look, maybe we can play more some other time.|And here, take your money back too. Just be glad we're working together.|I would've pocketed all of this otherwise.

speak;Kai;Hey, Taiga! Got a minute? I'm up for a few games of blackjack if you are.
expression;Taiga;Smile
speak;Taiga;I'm always up for a game! Let's go!
speak;Kai;Before we do, how about we make this more interesting?
speak;Taiga;Whatcha got in mind?
speak;Kai;The loser has to do whatever the winner tells them to do.
expression;Taiga;NoSmile
speak;Taiga;Whoa there, those are some pretty high stakes.
speak;Kai;What are you so worried about?|I thought you said you were definitely gonna win next time. And now's next time.

speak;Taiga;Yeah? Yeah?!
speak;Kai;Tell me everything you know about Ryuuji. No lies and don't leave anything out.
bop_portrait;Taiga
speak;Taiga;Wha--That's it?!
speak;Kai;Yup. That's it.
expression;Taiga;CloseEyes
speak;Taiga;You sadistic little--|{c:e;Taiga;HalfCloseEyes}Ugh, whatever. A deal's a deal.|{c:e;Taiga;NormalBlink}Anyway, Ryuuji's been captain of the Wyrmfang Pirates for three or so years now.|He wasn't always part of the crew.|We took him prisoner years ago during our last raid on Edoyama.
expression;Kai;NoSmile
speak;Kai;Speaking of that, why did you stop your raids on the capital?|It would've been a lucrative target.
speak;Taiga;Well, we gotta let our targets build up before we knock 'em down, y'know?|Otherwise, there'd be nothing left to steal.|On top of that, Ryuuji outright commanded us to stop raids on the capital|from the moment he was promoted to captain.
speak;Kai;Huh.
speak;Taiga;'Course, some of the crew didn't like that, so some of them just up and left.
expression;Kai;CloseEyes
speak;Kai;I see{tgm}...{tgm}|{c:e;Kai;NormalBlink}Anything else about Ryuuji specifically?
speak;Taiga;He doesn't like talking about himself too much.|The only other stuff I know is that he was working under the imperial family|and just used Ryuuji as a nickname.|His real name's Kenji.
speak;Kai;Anything else? Anything at all?
expression;Taiga;CloseEyes
speak;Taiga;Hmm{tgm}...{tgm}|{c:e;Taiga;NormalBlink}Nope, that's all I've got.
expression;Kai;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Kai;Okay.
expression;Taiga;CloseEyes
speak;Taiga;Man, all that just for some info{tgm}...{tgm}|{c:e;Taiga;NormalBlink}Why do you wanna know so much about him anyway?
expression;Kai;NormalBlink
speak;Kai;{tgm}...{tgm} Personal reasons.

speak;Taiga;KAI!
speak;Kai;Wh-Whoa there! Taiga, what's gotten you so worked up?
speak;Taiga;You never told me you and the captain were close!!
expression;Kai;CloseEyes,Smile
speak;Kai;You never asked.
speak;Taiga;I{tgm}...!{tgm} Huh.
expression;Taiga;CloseEyes
speak;Taiga;Yeah, you have a point actually--
expression;Taiga;NormalBlink
speak;Taiga;Wait, no, yer distractin' me here!|I gotta ask you something real important. Something only you would probably know!
expression;Kai;NormalBlink,Smile
speak;Kai;Uh-huh?
speak;Taiga;Is he more of a "flowers and chocolates" sort of guy or|a "take out on a nice dinner date" sort of guy?
expression;Kai;NoSmile
speak;Kai;I{tgm}...{tgm} What?
speak;Taiga;I can't just ask him about this stuff and|the rest of the crew ain't gonna know anything about that.
speak;Kai;I get that, but why do you think I would know?|And WHY do you want to know in the first place?
expression;Taiga;Smile
speak;Taiga;You're a smart guy and you know stuff!
expression;Taiga;HalfCloseEyes,NoSmile
speak;Taiga;And, well{tgm}...
expression;Taiga;CloseEyes
speak;Taiga;Oh, don't make me answer that last question out loud, alright?!

speak;Kai;Oh, dear Merin{tgm}...
expression;Kai;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Kai;Taiga, Kenji is{tgm}...
expression;Kai;NormalBlink
speak;Kai;He may not look it, but he's a sentimental guy deep down.
speak;Taiga;Uh-huh? Yeah?
speak;Kai;So, if you wanna let him know that you like him,|you gotta show him how much he means to you.
expression;Taiga;CloseEyes
speak;Taiga;Hmm{tgm}...{tgm} Got it, got it.
expression;Taiga;HalfCloseEyes
speak;Taiga;But, uh, how do I do that exactly?
expression;Kai;CloseEyes
speak;Kai;That's something you gotta figure out on your own.
expression;Kai;NormalBlink
speak;Kai;But, if I may make a suggestion,|maybe you could give your headband to him as a gift?
expression;Taiga;NormalBlink
speak;Taiga;Huh? Why my headband?
expression;Kai;Smile
speak;Kai;You're always wearing it, right?|Giving him something of yours that you're attached to|can really convey that you trust him, y'know?
expression;Taiga;Smile
bop_portrait;Taiga
speak;Taiga;Oh, yeah, I see! Thanks, Kai!|I'm gonna do that right now!
