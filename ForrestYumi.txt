Yumi: Well hey there, handsome. Hard at work with that sword of yours as usual.
Forrest: I do have a name, you know.
Yumi: I'm sure you do, so how long have you been a knight? You could be my shining knight
Forrest: Where'd you come from? The brothel
Yumi: Execuse me? Slap
Forrest: Ow! That stung
Yumi: Oh did little old me hurt you? Should I get a bandage for your big boo-boo
Forrest...that...is unnecessary...just what do you want?
Yumi: To talk and it seems you need to learn some manners. That was no way for you to speak with a woman
Forrest: Well if you didn't dress like...that maybe people wouldn't have that impression
Yumi: Oh you mean these? My boobies, my massive fu
Forrest: Yes, yes that is what I mean that is quite enough of that.
