Celeste: Miss Felicity said that we needed more firewood. So glad she asked me to do it. It just means more axe practice! Okay, log, you're dead! Oh, and so are you! Chop! Chop! Chop!
(Masashi enters the scene.)
Masashi: Excuse me, little lady?
Celeste: Huh? Who? Oh, hey there! Wait, aren't you that arrow guy who's always talking to girls?
Masashi: ... My name is Masashi, and I'm an archer, yes. And yes, I suppose I do talk to girls a lot. That is all beside the point. At any rate, what are you up to?
Celeste: Miss Felicity needed some more firewood, so I got asked to do it. HOORAH! Chop!
Masashi: Still, wouldn't a more elegant weapon suit a young lady like yourself?
Celeste: And what would you suggest, mister? A sword? Everyone uses a sword!
Masashi: Swords are a fine weapon. But, no, little lady. I had the bow in mind.
Celeste: A bow?
Masashi: Absolutely. Truly a fine, elegant weapon that only the most gifted use.
Celeste: Why do you say only that?
Masashi: Very few possess the dexterous finesse to use one. Why, just look at this army. Most focus on martial weapons or the arcane arts, yet only a handful have learned to wield the bow, let alone master it.
Celeste: Huh, you have a point.
Masashi: So, what do you say? Would you like to learn?
Celeste: Sure! Just as soon as I finish chopping this wood. CHOP!
Masashi: Celeste, wait!
Celeste: Huh?
Masashi: Don't hit that piece you just split. With some work, that would make a great bow. Could I have it? I can fashion it into one for you.
Celeste: Oh? Okay, go ahead.
Masashi: And before I go, mind pulling the string on my bow? I want an idea how strong you are.
Celeste: I'm plenty strong!
Masashi: I can see that! However, a bow and its string needs to be adjusted to its user's strength. I need an idea of how to make this bow suitable for you.
Celeste: Ohhhh, well, why didn't you say so? Lemme give it a try.
(Celeste attempts to pull the string.)
Celeste: Whew! Why is such a slim piece of string so hard to pull?
Masashi: You did better than I thought you would, though. Thank you, Celeste. I'll catch up with you when I finish making a bow that you can draw.
Celeste: Okay, mister! This sounds fun!

Masashi: Oh Celeste there you are! I made the bow, here give it a pull. How does it feel?
Celeste: Oh cool! You made this? Wow....hey this isn't so bad it's easy actually.
Masashi: Wait till you've loosed your 50th arrow it can get tiring
Celeste: Ok so I put the arrow on the string, pull and...aw man it fell off
Masashi: Don't worry about that it happens to everyone when they first start
Many missed shots later
Celeste: Ah man! This is dumb! I could have hit that target with just a handaxe by now
Masashi: But how many times in a row can you hit it by throwing an axe Celeste?
Celeste: I dunno...maybe 5?
Masashi: Observe...whoosh,whoosh,whoosh,whoosh,whoosh-whoosh-whoosh-whoosh-whoosh!
Celste: Oh wow! They're all in the center
Masashi: Not just that look at the grouping, they're all tight up against each other A bow takes time but once you grasp it there's nothing else like it. The bow is the pinnacle ranged weapon Celeste and every bow is personal to the archer
[NEEDS REVISION]
	Celeste: Hmmm...you know after having pulled a bow I can believe that with an axe I could easily use Captain Taylor's or someone else's axe but a bow not really
[END REVISION SECTION]
Masashi: Don't get discouraged Celeste the bow is a great weapon but it does take time and a lot of practice but once grasped you can more easily hit enemies at a distance
Celeste: I think I understand I'll keep practicing mister...you sure everyone has this experience? I'm not just a dunce with a bow am I?
Masashi: Absolutely not everyone struggles in the beginning
Celeste: Even you?
Masashi: ...sigh...yes even I. As embarrassing to admit that as it is
Celeste: Ok! I'll keep practicing and I'll be the best archer in this army!
