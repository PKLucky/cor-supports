Celeste- Hmmm miss Felicity said that we needed more firewood. So glad she asked me as it gives me some more axe practice. Ok log you’re dead! Oh and so are you! Chop! Chop! Chop!
Masashi: Goodness! What on earth is that child up to?
???Execuse me little lady?
Celeste “Hurr…uh? Who are you? Wait aren’t you that arrow guy who’s always talking to girls?
Masashi “... My name is Masashi and I’m an archer, yes I suppose I do talk to girls a lot. What are you up to?
Celeste: Felicity needed some more firewood so I got asked to do it. HOORAH! Chop!
Masashi: Why wasn’t Michael asked? Chopping wood is hard work fo……well it’s hard work can be really exhausting.
Celeste: Have you seen him use an axe before?
Masashi: No I can’t say I have
Celeste: Exactly CHOP!
Masashi: Still you should use a more elegant weapon not a brutish weapon like an axe.
Celeste: And what would you suggest mister? A sword? Everyone uses a sword but I’m the only girl with an axe..or I was until Taiga. Point still stands!
Masashi “Swords are a fine weapon but no little lady, I had the bow in mind
Celeste “A bow?”
Masashi “Absolutely. Truly a fine, elegant weapon that only the most gifted use.”
Celeste “Why do you say only the most gifted?”
Masashi “How many archers are there in the army?”
Celeste “Well there’s you and…”
Masashi “Exactly.”
Celeste “Don’t use my own words against me mister! That’s mean.” (is smiling though)
Masashi “Wouldn’t dream of it. Shall I show you how to use a bow?
Celeste “Sure! Just as soon as I finish chopping this wood. CHOP!
Masashi “Celeste wait!
Celeste “Huh?
Masashi “Don’t hit that piece you just split. With some work that would make a great bow. Could I have it? I can fashion it into a bow for you.
Celeste “Oh? Ok go ahead.”
Masashi “Here before I go mind pulling the string on my bow? I want an idea how strong you are
Celeste “I’m strong!”
Masashi “Not like that, bows are very different from lifting big logs or boulders.
Celeste “Oh, ok I’ll give it a try. Hurgh….hurgh. Why is such a slim piece of string so hard to pull?
Masashi “You did better than I thought you would. Thank you Celeste, I’ll catch up with you when I finish making a bow that you can draw.
Celeste “Ok mister! This sounds fun!
Masashi thinking (Impressive she’s a good kid but she needs to be directed down a proper path or there’s no telling what she’ll grow up into. She has an impressive draw pull though I better get to work)
