[Alex walks in on Aqua brewing some tea. The two of them talk about tea blends they've tried and tea types that are traditionally drunk in their respective regions. Alex begins to brainstorm some new tea blend ideas and asks Aqua if she wants to try them once she figures out proper recipes for them. Aqua accepts.]

[Alex begins brewing her new tea blends and Aqua tries them out. At some point, Alex accidentally adds an unintended ingredient to one of the blends. Alex is about to separate the ingredient from the blend, but Aqua insists on keeping it in there just to see if it will work. Alex hesitates, but agrees. Aqua tries the tea, and likes it a lot. She proposes adding the extra ingredient to other blends and see if that will bring out new exotic flavors.]
