C Support [Considering to turn this into a Chell/Aqua support with some revisions.]
Aqua: Now, let's see, what can I top this with? Oh, pineapple! I've always wanted to try pineapple. Something sweet like this should go with something savory... Maybe the ham?
(Alex enters the scene.)
Alex: Aqua? What might you be doing in the kitchen?
Aqua: Oh, hello, Alex! I just wanted to make myself a light snack before bed.
Alex: This seems like a lot for a "light" snack. What do you plan on doing with all of this?
Aqua: I wanted to try to recreate a popular dish from southern Foliaga. You take slices of bread and top it with tomato, cheese, a bit of garlic, and meat. Typically thinly sliced pork or sausage.
Alex: That sounds delicious. But if that's what you're making, why the pineapple?
Aqua: I wanted to experiment with more exotic ingredients. It's a rare opportunity to have access to ingredients from all over Yondo.
Alex: Being in Medeas does have its perks.
Aqua: Mm-hm! Oh, while you're here, why don't you try some?
Alex: A-Ah, are you sure...? I mean...
Alex, thinking: I'm all for experimenting in the kitchen, but pineapple with ham? And the tomato and the garlic too... I'm not so sure about this.
Alex: I'd love to, really, but... I'm still quite full from dinner earlier. So maybe some other time, Aqua.
Aqua: That's okay! More for me, then.
