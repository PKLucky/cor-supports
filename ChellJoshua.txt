expression;Joshua;NoSmile
speak;Joshua;I was wondering if we could do a quick spar.|I wanna see just how strong you really are!

speak;Joshua;Wow, nimble AND strong. Not bad at all, Chell.
expression;Chell;Smile
speak;Chell;You're not so bad yourself.|{c:e;Chell;NoSmile}I'm surprised at how easily you can swing that sword around.|Why, it looks more like a slab of metal than an actual blade.
expression;Joshua;NoSmile
speak;Joshua;Old Iron is heavy, sure, but these muscles aren't just for show, you know.
speak;Chell;Yes. Of course. Right.{c:e;Chell;CloseEyes} Ahem.|{c:e;Chell;NormalBlink}At any rate, how did you come to wield{tgm}...{tgm} "Old Iron", was it?
speak;Joshua;Took a lot of strength training to actually lift up this bad boy.|It was my father's sword at first, actually.|He said he'd only hand it down to me if I could lift it.{c:e;Joshua;Smile}You can see how that went.
speak;Chell;Oh my. Your father must have also been quite a strong man.
speak;Joshua;Sure was.|{c:e;Joshua;CloseEyes,Smile}Old Iron looked so natural in his hands. He could swing it with ease.|Even more than I ever could.
speak;Chell;Fascinating.

speak;Joshua;You alright, Chell? You look flushed.

speak;Joshua;Sure! I don't mind at all.

Chell: Joshua? Could we talk I was watching you train again
Joshua: Sure! What’s up?
Chell: In a strange way, you remind me of my father. Not your mannerisms more your fighting philosophy. Your emphasis on offense, father always said “Don’t worry about blocking that’s not what an axe is for. Get in and get it done, finish them off quickly the best defense is a good offense”
Joshua: Ha-ha-ha! Smart man.
Chell: He was faster, than you are, leaner and more agile than you are and not as tall but seeing you train reminds me of him and his teachings
