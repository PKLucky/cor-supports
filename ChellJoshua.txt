Joshua: Man, Chell, you're not as frail as other Pegasus riders I've seen. You've got a good bit of bulk on ya!
Chell: Oh, um, thank you, Joshua. But, what's with this all of a sudden?
Joshua: I was wondering if we could do a quick spar. I wanna see just how strong you really are!
Chell: I would be glad to.
(Some time later...)
Joshua: Wow, nimble AND strong. Not bad at all, Chell.
Chell: You're not so bad yourself. I'm surprised at how easily you can swing that sword around. Why, it looks more like a slab of metal than an actual blade.
Joshua: Old Iron is heavy, sure, but these muscles aren't just for show, you know.
Chell: Yes. Of course. Right. Ahem. At any rate, how did you come to wield... "Old Iron", was it?
Joshua: Took a lot of strength training to actually lift up this bad boy. It was my father's sword at first, actually. He said he'd only hand it down to me if I could lift it. You can see how that went.
Chell: Oh my. Your father must have also been quite a strong man.
Joshua: Sure was. Old Iron looked so natural in his hands. He could swing it with ease. Even more than I ever could.
Chell: Fascinating.
Joshua: You alright, Chell? You look flushed.
Chell: Ah, yes, I'm fine, thank you.
Joshua: Anyway, how about you? Where did you learn to use an axe?
Chell: From my father, Sir Gibson. He was a good man and a good teacher.
Joshua: Was he your only teacher? At least when it came to axe training?
Chell: Yes, he was.
Joshua: That explains a lot, then. When you fight, one swing flows right into the next. It's almost like a dance.
Chell: Why, thank you. Father would be pleased to hear you say that. Say, why don't we train together sometime? We could compare our techniques up close.
Joshua: Sure! I don't mind at all.

Chell: Joshua? Could we talk? I was watching you train again.
Joshua: Sure! What’s up?
Chell: In a strange way, you remind me of my father. Not your mannerisms, more your fighting philosophy. More specifically, your emphasis on offense. Father always said "Don’t worry about blocking. That's not what an axe is for. Get in and get it done. Finish them off quickly. The best defense is a good offense."
Joshua: Hahaha! Smart man.
Chell: He was faster, leaner, and more agile than you are, and not as tall. But seeing you train reminds me of him and his teachings.
